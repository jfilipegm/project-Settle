"""Revision-95/96 verification pass for item 372(h)'s graph arm
(`OPUS-R119-001`, tightened by `OPUS-R120`).

`verify_372h_lock_primitive_predicate.py` mechanizes the completeness arm
(which pathnames are primitives) but, as `OPUS-R119` found, "there is none
[no code-derived reproduction] for the edge set, and the edge set is where
every error of the last four rounds has landed" -- `OPUS-R92-004`,
`OPUS-R93-002`, `WF8C-S372H-001`, `OPUS-R118-001`/`-002`, and
`OPUS-R119-001` itself are five separate rounds in which a hand-written
edge list was found short. This script closes that gap for the edges that
are genuinely closable: the ones provable from `scripts/workflow_state.py`
alone.

**workflow-v2.4.0 overlay note (plan-amendment-mechanism round 8,
`XMODEL-R8-B1`):** `claim_checkpoint`'s own publication now runs inside a
`with state_lock(repo_root):` block (closing the race between
`request_plan_amendment`'s authoritative `resolve_claim(...)` read and its
`AMENDING_PLAN` commit -- within one worktree root; see `XMODEL-R9-B1` and
`docs/defects/v2.4.0-002-amendment-claim-race-crosses-worktree-boundary.md`
for the cross-worktree residual this closure does not reach), which the
"Guard-bracket nesting" shape already
generalizes over -- `state_lock` is already one of the five bare
`fcntl.flock` context managers this shape's own detection walks, so this is
a new call site of an existing mechanism, not a new detection rule. This
overlay copy is the one place that new edge, `(2)->(8)`, is declared;
`docs/ai-workflow/WORKFLOW_V2_PLAN.md`'s own eleven-edge table (this
overlay's own copy) is this script's evidence source, exactly as before.

**workflow-2.6.0 overlay note (`D-Repo-Global-Lifecycle`, CP6; closes
`v2.4.0-002`):** primitive (9), the repository-global per-work-item
lifecycle `flock` (`<git-common-dir>/ai-workflow/checkpoint-claims/
<token>.lifecycle.lock`), is a new `with lifecycle_lock(...):` context
manager, so its edges are instances of the existing "Guard-bracket nesting"
shape (`DIRECT_WITH_PRIMITIVE["lifecycle_lock"] = "9"`), not a new
detection rule. Five edges out of (9) are rediscovered: `(9)->(2)`,
`(9)->(8)` (`claim_checkpoint`), `(9)->(6)`, `(9)->(8)` (`adopt_claim`),
`(9)->(6)`, `(9)->(5)` and `(9)->(3)` (an absent-claim `take_over_claim`,
whose (5) window establishes this worktree's identity). The plan's hand
count named the first four; `(9)->(3)` was found by this script, which is
what it exists for. No edge targets (9): it is a pure source. The totals
are sixteen edges (twelve code-derivable, four command-orchestrated), nine
blocking and seven non-blocking; the blocking sources `{1, 5, 8, 9}` and
targets `{2, 3, 6}` stay disjoint.

**The raw edge set is not uniformly code-derivable, and this script does
not pretend otherwise.** Eleven edges are declared, read fresh from
`docs/ai-workflow/WORKFLOW_V2_PLAN.md`'s own fenced eleven-edge table
(`parse_declared_raw_edges_from_plan` below) rather than duplicated as a
second hand-maintained Python literal (`OPUS-R120-002`: the prior
`RAW_EDGES = CODE_DERIVABLE | COMMAND_ORCHESTRATED` definition made the
union/equality check compare a set against itself -- provably unreachable
dead code, confirmed by 200 000 randomised trials never firing it). Seven
are provable from this module's own AST -- two structural shapes, both
mechanized below:

  - **Guard-bracket nesting**: a `with G(...):` block, where `G` is one of
    this module's lock-opening functions (the bare `fcntl.flock`
    context managers, plus `owner_mutation`/`plan_approval_guarded_mutation`,
    whose own bodies open guard (6)/(7) and hand the caller a still-open
    lease (5)/(1)) -- every acquisition reachable, transitively through
    same-module calls, from that block's own body is a target of an edge
    sourced at `G`'s primitive. Produces `(7)->(1)`, `(6)->(5)`, `(6)->(8)`,
    and, since round 8 (`XMODEL-R8-B1`), `(2)->(8)` (`claim_checkpoint`'s own
    `with state_lock(repo_root):` block, reaching `_claim_or_refuse`'s
    `os.link`).
  - **Manual acquire/release window**: the same relationship, for the two
    places this module hands back a *value* (a lease dict) instead of using
    a context manager -- `lease = acquire_guard(...)` / `release_guard(...,
    lease)` and the `acquire_plan_approval_guard`/`release_plan_approval_guard`
    equivalent -- where every acquisition reachable from a call made
    between those two lines, in the same function, is a target of an edge
    sourced at the held lease's primitive. Produces `(5)->(3)` (via
    `take_over_claim`/`recover_abandoned_destructive_guard`, both of which
    call `_establish_or_repair_identity` inside this exact window -- true
    independently of the command-file orchestration `(5)->(2)` needs, per
    `OPUS-R119` observation 3).
  - **The claim's existence window, scoped to `release_checkpoint`
    specifically** (primitive (8) is not a guard -- there is no
    `acquire_claim`/`release_claim` pair to generalize the rule above to):
    `release_checkpoint` is the one function in this module that both opens
    a window reaching guard (6) and lease (5) (via `with owner_mutation(...):`)
    *and*, later in that same function body, unlinks claim (8)'s own
    pathname -- the unlink is proof, internal to this one function, that
    (8) was already durably published before the window opened (nothing in
    this module re-publishes it in between). Produces `(8)->(6)`, `(8)->(5)`.

**Four edges are not code-derivable, and are not claimed to be.** They
depend on `.claude/commands/milestone-implement.md`'s own step ordering --
which functions this module exposes as independently callable primitives
get invoked next to each other -- not on anything `scripts/workflow_state.py`
itself enforces:

  - `(1)->(2)`: no production call site at all (`plan_approval_guarded_mutation`
    has six call sites, all in `workflow_integration_test.py`) -- declared by
    design intent alone, per `OPUS-R116-004`'s original finding, unresolved
    by design (see item 372(h)'s own "declared, not derivable" clause). Its
    evidence is the sanctioned `D-Approval-Commits` step 8b procedure, not a
    current production call site -- `(1)->(2)` is tracked in
    `COMMAND_ORCHESTRATED` on that footing, exactly as the other three are on
    theirs, and is never asked to satisfy the mechanical AST check the seven
    code-derivable edges do.
  - `(5)->(2)`, `(8)->(2)`, `(8)->(3)`: real, live edges (step 1d/1f, per
    `.claude/commands/milestone-implement.md:121-136`), but nothing in
    `scripts/workflow_state.py` calls `claim_checkpoint`/`owner_mutation` next
    to each other in this order -- that sequencing is the command file's own
    orchestration, external to this module.

**Both directions of equality are checked, for the seven code-derivable edges
only**: every edge this script's own passes discover is asserted to be one
of the seven declared code-derivable edges (a spurious extra edge fails,
naming it -- the property `OPUS-R119` asked this arm to have); every one of
the seven declared code-derivable edges is asserted to be rediscovered (a
declared edge silently going stale -- e.g. a future refactor that moves
`_establish_or_repair_identity`'s call outside the guard window -- fails
too). The one shared `os.link` statement in this module
(`_publish_claim_exclusive`, reached from both `_publish_guard` (5) and
`_claim_or_refuse` (8)) is attributed *caller-aware* -- using the actual
call site the walk arrived through, not an over-approximation of every
primitive the statement could ever resolve to regardless of caller
(`OPUS-R120-001`: the prior over-approximation made `(6)->(5)` and
`(6)->(8)` alibi each other, so deleting either edge's only real code
evidence left it "discovered" anyway, satisfied by the other edge's own
evidence for the same shared statement -- reproduced below by
`MUTATION_REMOVE_6_TO_8`/`MUTATION_REMOVE_6_TO_5`, each removing exactly
one edge's only evidence independently). The four command-orchestrated
edges are compared, bidirectionally, against the same independently-parsed
plan table the seven code-derivable edges are (`parse_declared_raw_edges_from_plan`),
never claimed to pass the mechanical AST check the other seven do.

**Single-attempt precondition, call-chain-aware** (`OPUS-R119-004`,
tightened by `OPUS-R120-003`): the three `os.link`-based publication entry
points this design uses (`_publish_plan_approval_guard`, `_publish_guard`,
`_claim_or_refuse`) are non-blocking only so long as their own `os.link`
acquisition is never enclosed in a wait/retry construct -- checked not only
at the acquisition's own call site but transitively up through every frame
on its static call chain, to unbounded depth, mirroring the completeness
arm's own `eexist_guarded` climb, not a call-site-only lexical check a
one-frame wrapper around the *caller's* invocation would defeat (the exact
defect class `OPUS-R117-002` found and fixed for the EEXIST clause,
reappearing here for the wait/retry clause -- reproduced below by
`MUTATION_WRAP_PUBLISH_GUARD_CALL_IN_RETRY`, which wraps `_publish_guard`'s
own call to `_publish_claim_exclusive` in a retry loop one frame away from
the `os.link` statement itself, never moving that statement).
