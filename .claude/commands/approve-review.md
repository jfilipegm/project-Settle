description: Approve the plan or implementation stage for the active (or named) work item. User-only -- never invoked by Claude autonomously.
argument-hint: <plan|implementation> [work-item-id]
disable-model-invocation: true
state_writer: true
review-subject: bundle
---

**State-writer discipline (D1, item 354):** every `docs/ai-workflow/WORKFLOW_STATE.json` write this command performs -- everywhere a step below says "persist the returned state" -- is performed by calling `workflow_state.state_transaction(repo_root, mutator)`, never by a separate read-then-write: `state_transaction` holds `.ai-review/runtime/WORKFLOW_STATE.lock` (`workflow_state.state_lock`, `fcntl.flock(LOCK_EX)`) across the complete re-read -> apply-the-named-function -> canonical-serialize -> atomic-publish sequence in one process invocation, so `mutator` is the exact transition function each step below names (e.g. `lambda state: workflow_state.<fn>(state, ...)`), applied to freshly re-read state rather than to a snapshot taken before the lock was acquired.

Enter `AWAITING_PLAN_APPROVAL` or `AWAITING_TECHNICAL_APPROVAL`
(`docs/ai-workflow/MILESTONE_WORKFLOW.md`) for the stage named in
`$ARGUMENTS` (`plan` or `implementation`), for the work item also named in
`$ARGUMENTS` or, if omitted, `active_work_item_id`.

`<bundle_dir>`/`<feedback_dir>` below resolve per
`docs/ai-workflow/REVIEW_PROTOCOL.md`'s "Bundle location"
(`workflow_fingerprint.resolve_bundle_dir`/`resolve_feedback_dir`). This
command runs at both stages, so pass the stage it was invoked for:
`resolve_bundle_dir(repo_root, work_item_id, stage="plan")` on the plan
stage, which is always `.ai-review/<work_item_id>/current/`, and
`resolve_bundle_dir(repo_root, work_item_id)` (no stage argument, the
scoped-else-flat compatibility rule) on the technical/implementation
stage, whose bundle may genuinely be on the flat layout when it was
generated without `prepare-ai-review.sh`'s optional `[work-item-id]`
argument. `<feedback_dir>` takes no stage argument at either stage.

**This command is user-only by construction.** `disable-model-invocation:
true` is the primary, harness-enforced control (blocks the SlashCommand
tool). Claude must never invoke it on the user's own behalf, including as a
step of another command's execution, independent of that flag.

**User-only guard, mechanism (2)**: refuse to write anything unless the
user's own current-turn message supplies literal confirmation text naming
the exact `work_item_id` and the exact stage (`plan`/`implementation`)
being approved (`workflow_state.validate_user_confirmation`). Never
fabricate, infer, or carry over this text from a prior turn.

**Verified coverage of mechanism (1)** (`docs/ai-workflow/WORKFLOW_V2_PLAN.md`
D2, resolves `OPUS-R6-010`): this installation's own bundled frontmatter
reference documents `disable-model-invocation: true` as blocking only "the
SlashCommand tool" -- it does not name the Skill exposure path at all. The
installed Claude Code changelog separately confirms skill-aware handling of
`disable-model-invocation: true` (a fix for skills with that flag failing
when invoked via `/<skill>` mid-message), suggesting real coverage there
too. A same-session empirical test was inconclusive: this harness's model
tool surface exposes commands to Claude exclusively through the `Skill`
tool (no distinct `SlashCommand` tool is present in the available tool
set), but the skill-routing table is fixed at session start, so a
newly-flagged command reliably returns "Unknown skill" whether or not the
flag actually gates it -- a decisive test requires invoking a flagged
command via `Skill` from a **fresh session** after this file lands. Until
that fresh-session result is recorded, treat mechanism (2) above as the
actually load-bearing control for the Skill exposure path, not mechanism
(1) alone.

0. **Dual-mode branch** (Workflow v2.1, `WF4a-ii`; widened workflow-2.5.0 to
   a third `governing_workflow_version` branch): resolve the target work
   item (named argument, or `active_work_item_id`) and read its
   `governing_workflow_version` from `docs/ai-workflow/WORKFLOW_STATE.json`.
   - **`governing_workflow_version: "1"`**: steps 1-7 execute exactly as
     written.
   - **`governing_workflow_version: "2.1"`**: steps 1-7 execute identically;
     for the plan stage only, step 1's gate-reachability check additionally
     requires `workflow_state.plan_approval_gate_reachable(...)`'s
     `TWO_STAGE_PLAN_REVIEW_VERSIONS` branch (the `plan_review_stages`
     ledger, populated by `/review-plan`/`/record-manual-plan-review`,
     `D-Plan-Review-Stages`) — fully live, and, since workflow-2.5.0, no
     longer inert for this repository's own installation either
     (`workflow-2.5.0` correction, `LOCAL_MODEL_PLAN_REVIEW` round 5): this
     repository now carries two `"2.1"`-governed work items
     (`plan-amendment-mechanism`, `implementation-review-two-stage`) whose
     own plan-stage approvals exercise this branch directly. The prior
     text's claim that this branch was "inert... because this repository's
     own work item is fixed at `"1"`" was true only while
     `workflow-v2-1-core` was this repository's sole tracked work item; it
     no longer is, and this branch is not, and never was, inert in general
     — it governs every `"2.1"`-governed work item anywhere this Workflow
     is installed.
   - **`governing_workflow_version: "2.2"`** (workflow-2.5.0,
     `D-Implementation-Review-Version-Activation`): steps 1-7 execute
     identically to the `"2.1"` branch immediately above for the **plan**
     stage — the two-stage plan-review protocol is unaffected by this
     version bump, since `TWO_STAGE_PLAN_REVIEW_VERSIONS` already covers
     both `"2.1"`/`"2.2"`. For the **implementation** stage only, step 1's
     gate-reachability check additionally applies
     `workflow_state.technical_approval_gate_reachable(...)`'s own
     `"2.2"`-only ledger check, active exactly when this item's own
     `governing_workflow_version` is `"2.2"` — mirroring the plan stage's
     existing `plan_review_stages` check exactly, substituted for the
     implementation-stage ledger (both `LOCAL_MODEL_IMPLEMENTATION_REVIEW`/
     `MANUAL_EXTERNAL_IMPLEMENTATION_REVIEW` required `APPROVE` against the
     current `review_content_id`, `D-Implementation-Review-Stages`). Step
     1 passes this item's real `governing_workflow_version`,
     `implementation_review_stages`, and the current implementation-stage
     `review_content_id` to that call **unconditionally, for every
     governing version, not only when it is `"2.2"`** — these three are
     required parameters on that function now (round 7's `I1`), so this
     command must always state the work item's actual values rather than
     branch on version to decide whether to pass them at all; the
     function's own internal `!= "2.2"` check is what keeps a `"1"`/`"2.1"`
     item's outcome unchanged.
   - **Any other `governing_workflow_version`** (including one this module
     does not recognize): refuse cleanly, naming the actual value — never
     guess which branch above applies (round-7 optional finding 2, the same
     explicit-refusal discipline `/milestone-implement`'s own step 0
     states).
1. **Confirm gate reachability**: read `<feedback_dir>/REVIEW_FEEDBACK.md`'s
   most recently reviewed round status and bundle ID
   (`workflow_fingerprint.parse_review_feedback_binding_fields`) —
   missing/mismatched `Reviewed bundle ID:`/`Reviewed base commit:`/
   `Work item:` fields are not fatal to reading the file (an
   `EXTERNAL_APPROVE` basis simply becomes unreachable, per step 3), but
   report the mismatch naming both values (`WFR-03`).
   **Implementation stage only — durable `BLOCK`-verdict pin, defense in
   depth** (`D2a`, `WF8c` item (a)): recompute the current implementation-
   stage `bundle_id` now (the same recomputation step 2 repeats and
   displays; reuse this value through steps 1-3 of this invocation rather
   than recomputing it a third time). If the feedback's `status` is
   exactly `BLOCK`: call `workflow_state.state_transaction(repo_root,
   lambda state: workflow_state.record_technical_review_block_pin(state,
   work_item_id, bundle_id=<the current bundle_id>,
   review_content_id=<the current implementation-stage review_content_id>,
   now=<now>))` and persist the returned state — idempotent, exactly as
   `/apply-implementation-review` step 1's own writer call, present here
   only as a second, independent recording path in case that command's
   own write was never reached. Then compute `pinned =
   workflow_state.is_technical_review_block_pinned(work_item, <the current
   bundle_id>)` (re-reading the work item after the call above, so a pin
   just recorded is already reflected) and pass it as `pinned_block` to
   both `technical_approval_gate_reachable` below and `resolve_approval_basis`
   in step 3. Plan stage: `pinned_block` is never computed or passed — D2a
   is an implementation-stage-only mechanism.
   Call
   `workflow_state.approval_gate_reachable(status)` for the plan stage on a
   `"1"` item (`plan_approval_gate_reachable(...)` on a `"2.1"`/`"2.2"`
   item — both governed by `TWO_STAGE_PLAN_REVIEW_VERSIONS`), or
   `workflow_state.technical_approval_gate_reachable(..., pinned_block=pinned,
   governing_workflow_version=work_item.get("governing_workflow_version"),
   implementation_review_stages=work_item.get("implementation_review_stages"),
   current_review_content_id=<the current implementation-stage
   review_content_id, already recomputed above>)` for the implementation
   stage, **at every governing version alike, unconditionally** — never only
   on a `"2.2"` branch (workflow-2.5.0 REVISE round 7's own `I1`: these
   three are required keyword-only parameters on this function now, exactly
   like `plan_approval_gate_reachable`'s own equivalents always have been;
   omitting any of them raises `TypeError` instead of silently defaulting,
   so a caller can no longer forget `governing_workflow_version` for a
   `"2.2"` item and have the ledger check silently skipped. The function's
   own `!= "2.2"` branch is what keeps this behavior-preserving for a
   `"1"`/`"2.1"` item — passing its real `governing_workflow_version` and
   `implementation_review_stages` here changes nothing for it, since both
   values are already computed at this point in the step regardless of
   version). The latter's `protected_path_dirty` argument is
   `workflow_state.any_protected_path_dirty(...)` (`WF4a-iii`), called with
   the implementation-stage classification
   (`workflow_fingerprint.load_implementation_stage_classification(...)`) —
   `WORKFLOW_STATE.json`/`WORKFLOW_CONFIG.json` dirtiness never blocks this,
   by construction of that classification. Its
   `head_matches_reviewed_implementation_head` argument (`WF4c`,
   D-Approval-Commits, revised `WF8B-003`) is **never** a bare
   `work_item["reviewed_implementation_head"] == <live HEAD SHA>` equality
   — that bare form was proven permanently self-invalidating (a mandatory
   post-generation durability commit is always one commit ahead of the
   value it just wrote, re-breaking the equality on every round; see
   `docs/ai-workflow/WORKFLOW_V2_PLAN.md`'s "WF8b finding disposition
   (revision 27 → 28)"). Call
   `workflow_state.implementation_provenance_interval_reachable(repo_root,
   work_item, base_commit)`, which is `True` exactly when
   `workflow_state.verify_implementation_provenance_interval(...)` finds a
   valid interval: live HEAD is exactly the discovered current
   `Workflow-Bundle-Generation-Record: <work_item_id>/<implementation_revision>`
   commit `T` (never merely a descendant of it), `reviewed_implementation_head`
   is reachable from `T` via `T`'s own first-parent chain, every commit
   strictly between them either classifies implementation-stage
   excluded-only or, if it is itself a historical
   `Workflow-Bundle-Generation-Record` commit for this pair (a prior
   same-content-republication link, `WF8c` (c)), satisfies its own
   role-specific contract and chain-continuity instead, and `T` itself
   passes its own role-specific commit contract — the ordinary role
   (touches only `WORKFLOW_STATE.json`, changes only the five allowed
   fields, carries exactly the two-trailer ordinary set) or the
   **recovered** role (`WF8c` (c): touches only `WORKFLOW_STATE.json`,
   changes only `phase`/`state_revision`/`last_transition` —
   `reviewed_implementation_head`/`implementation_revision` byte-identical
   to its parent — carries exactly the three-trailer
   `Workflow-Bundle-Generation-Record` + `Workflow-Work-Item` +
   `Workflow-Supersedes` set, and its own `Workflow-Supersedes` trailer
   names exactly the immediately preceding generation-record commit in the
   chain). On refusal, call `verify_implementation_provenance_interval`
   directly and report its raised exception's message — it names the
   concrete reason (no record commit found, a further unrecorded commit
   landed past `T`, `reviewed_implementation_head` not an ancestor, a
   merge/non-first-parent interval, a protected path inside the interval,
   a malformed record commit, or a broken supersession chain — a fork, a
   cycle, a skipped link, or a non-terminal member failing its own role
   contract) rather than a bare boolean. A `None`
   `reviewed_implementation_head` (nothing has ever generated a bundle for
   this work item) is caught the same way, by
   `BundleGenerationRecordNotFoundError`. A `BLOCK` status, or an unmet
   additional condition, stops here — report why, do not proceed.
   *The recovered-role commit shape and its supersession-chain validation
   are implemented (`WF8c` (c), reachable via `/apply-implementation-review`'s
   and `/apply-functional-review`'s own `resolve_bundle_generation_outcome`-
   driven `record_bundle_generation` call) and, separately, via the
   dedicated `/recover-implementation-provenance` command (`WF8c` (b)),
   invocable only from `AWAITING_EXTERNAL_IMPLEMENTATION_REVIEW` itself,
   for a bundle staled by a concurrent excluded-only commit landing after
   `T` while no new implementation round has started — the only phase from
   which `record_bundle_generation`'s own legal source phases are
   unreachable without first re-entering either kind of remediation cycle.
   `record_bundle_generation`'s legality is stage-specific
   (`workflow-v2-3-followups` continued scope,
   `BUNDLE_GENERATION_LEGAL_SOURCE_PHASES_BY_STAGE`), not a flat two-phase
   set: `stage="implementation"` only from `SELF_REVIEWING_IMPLEMENTATION`;
   `stage="post-fix"` from `APPLYING_REVIEW_FEEDBACK` (an ordinary
   implementation-review REVISE round) or from `AWAITING_FUNCTIONAL_REVIEW`
   (`/apply-functional-review`'s own bounded-fix branch) — the latter only
   when `technical_approval.status == "STALE"`
   (`BundleGenerationRequiresStaleTechnicalApprovalError` otherwise). This
   third, functional-review source weakens none of this command's own
   stale-bundle/approval guards: the `STALE` gate means a `CURRENT`
   approval can never take this path at all; `/apply-functional-review`
   step 4 still re-checks the `REJECTED`-bundle marker (`WFR-67`) before
   generating, the same as the ordinary post-fix path; and
   `resolve_bundle_generation_outcome` still independently re-derives the
   outcome from real Git content, never merely trusting which phase the
   caller arrived from.*
2. **Recompute fresh**: `bundle_id` over the current bundle and the
   stage-appropriate `review_content_id` (`scripts/workflow_fingerprint.py`)
   over the working tree. Display both, and the protected/excluded path
   lists, to the user. **Local worktree/HEAD staleness check**
   (`D-Bundle-Manifest`, resolves `OPUS-R6-016`): this command runs inside
   a real, current worktree, so call
   `workflow_fingerprint.assert_local_generation_matches(repo_root,
   <bundle_dir>/MANIFEST.md)` and stop, naming both the recorded and
   current worktree_root/HEAD, on a `WorktreeOrHeadMismatchError` — this
   is the actual first-party Milestone-8 incident (a stale bundle read
   from a different worktree). Never skip this because the recomputed
   `bundle_id` happens to still match; the two checks catch different
   failure modes. **`REJECTED`-bundle refusal, first of two, both stages**
   (`WFR-67`): also call
   `workflow_fingerprint.assert_bundle_not_rejected(repo_root,
   work_item_id)` here; a `BundleRejectedError` stops the command, naming
   the marker path and its recorded detail.
3. **Resolve the basis**: call `workflow_state.resolve_approval_basis(...)`
   with the feedback round's status/bundle_id, the freshly recomputed
   current bundle_id, this turn's literal `user_confirmation` text (if the
   user has not supplied it this turn, ask for it naming the exact
   `work_item_id` and stage, then stop and wait — never guess it),
   `work_item_id`, `stage`, and — implementation stage only — step 1's
   `pinned_block` (`D2a`, `WF8c` item (a)): the same positive-membership
   fact already passed to `technical_approval_gate_reachable`, so a
   pinned bundle refuses through this call too even if some other path
   ever reached step 3 without step 1's own gate check. Plan stage: never
   passed (D2a is implementation-stage-only). `BlockCannotApproveError`/
   `UserConfirmationRejectedError` stop the command; report the concrete
   reason.
4. **Build the record**: `workflow_state.build_approval_record(...)`, with
   `reviewed_content_commit` left unset for the plan stage (permanently
   null, `D-Approval-Commits`/`GPT-R9-006`) and set to the current
   `reviewed_implementation_head` for the implementation stage.
   **`review_content_manifest`, exact source** (self-discovered during
   this item's own `/accept-milestone` pre-flight, closed as continued
   `workflow-v2-3-followups` scope): whichever
   `workflow_fingerprint.compute_review_content_id_plan_stage[_at_commit[_for_work_item]]`/
   `compute_review_content_id_implementation_stage[_at_commit]` variant
   step 2 used to recompute `review_content_id` returns `(digest,
   projection)` — `build_approval_record`'s `review_content_manifest`
   argument is `projection["review_content_manifest"]`, the projection's
   own inner flat list of `{path, exists, mode, blob}` entries, **never**
   `projection` itself, which carries a field of the identical name one
   level up. Passing the whole projection now raises
   `InvalidApprovalRecordError` (`validate_approval_record`'s own shape
   check, added to close this exact trap after it silently produced two
   independently-malformed approval records — plan and technical — for
   this same work item).
4a. **Plan stage only — resolve the complete commit member set, before any
    durable mutation** (`D-Approval-Commits`' "Conditional fifth commit
    member", `GPT-R67-001`; generalized beyond `workflow-v2-1-core`'s own
    case). **Interim scope guard, `workflow-v2-1-core` only** (`WF8c`
    items 347/352's own retirement condition, stated as a condition
    rather than an open question): before anything else, if
    `work_item_id == "workflow-v2-1-core"` and `stage == "plan"`, read
    `docs/ai-workflow/WORKFLOW_V2_PLAN.md` and check whether it still
    contains the heading text `Bootstrap plan-approval procedure`. If it
    does, **stop**: report that `workflow-v2-1-core`'s own plan-stage
    approvals still go through `/bootstrap-workflow-v2`'s own checklist,
    not this command, until that section is withdrawn from
    `D-Approval-Commits` (gated on a technical approval covering this
    work item's own content, per the reconciliation table's `347-353`
    row) — do not attempt steps 4b onward. Every other work item, and
    `workflow-v2-1-core` itself once that heading is withdrawn, proceeds
    normally below.

    Call `plan =
    workflow_fingerprint.resolve_plan_stage_approval_commit_paths(repo_root,
    work_item_id, state_path=Path("docs/ai-workflow/WORKFLOW_STATE.json"))`
    (`plan` — referenced by that name in every step below). This returns
    the plan doc, registry JSON, mapping file and
    `WORKFLOW_STATE.json` (four members) plus, conditionally, this work
    item's own `<work_item_id>-artifacts.json` declaration as a fifth —
    included exactly when it is both pending (its working-tree bytes
    differ from `HEAD`) and fresh (byte-identical to the copy the
    just-recomputed bundle already captured). `StaleArtifactsDeclarationError`
    means the declaration changed again after the bundle was generated —
    stop and report it, naming both paths; do not stage, do not commit,
    do not open a transaction (identical in kind to a mismatched
    `bundle_id`/`review_content_id` refusal one step earlier).
    `MissingWorkItemArtifactsDeclarationError` here means this work item's
    own declaration is genuinely absent from the working tree, not merely
    uncommitted — the same fail-closed error step (2)'s recomputation
    already raises for that case, never masked. `fifth_member_path =
    plan.artifacts_declaration_path` (`None` if no fifth member applies)
    and `pinned_sha256 = plan.artifacts_declaration_sha256` — referenced
    by those names below for later re-verification. Implementation stage:
    unchanged, no resolution step — its four members are fixed, and none
    of steps 4b onward below apply to it; it keeps its own pre-`WF8c`
    write/commit/verify shape exactly as before, resuming at step 6's
    "Implementation stage" bullet.
4b. **Plan stage only — the plan-approval transaction precondition**
    (`WF8c` item 352, ownership-aware and guard-aware, mirroring
    `/bootstrap-workflow-v2`'s own step 0): call `evidence =
    workflow_state.plan_approval_takeover_evidence(repo_root)`. A
    non-`None` `evidence["journal"]` means a transaction from a prior,
    interrupted invocation of this command is already open; this fresh
    invocation never holds its `owner_token`. Report
    `evidence["owner_token"]`, `evidence["outcome"]`, `evidence["progress"]`'s
    last completed step (or that none is recorded), and
    `evidence["guard"]`'s state, and **stop** — do not open a second
    journal (`open_plan_approval_journal` would refuse this anyway,
    `PlanApprovalTransactionInProgressError`, but reporting first gives
    the user the exact recovery literal rather than a bare exception).
    **Target check, before the recovery below**: the journal is a single,
    repository-wide object, so the open transaction it describes may
    belong to a work item that is *not* this invocation's resolved
    target. Report `evidence["journal"]["work_item_id"]` alongside the
    values above, and when it differs from this invocation's own resolved
    `work_item_id`, say so plainly and tell the user to re-run targeting
    that work item — never take over, complete, or roll back another work
    item's approval under this one's invocation.
    `take_over_plan_approval_transaction` takes the resolved
    `work_item_id` as a **required** argument and refuses a mismatch with
    `PlanApprovalTakeoverWorkItemMismatchError`, having mutated nothing,
    so this is a fail-closed check in production rather than a rule this
    step is trusted to remember.

    Recovery: the user supplies the literal takeover authorization
    `workflow_state.plan_approval_takeover_authorization_literal(evidence)`
    (plus, if `evidence["guard"]` is held, the release literal
    `workflow_state.plan_approval_guard_release_authorization_literal(...)`)
    on a subsequent turn; only then call
    `workflow_state.take_over_plan_approval_transaction(repo_root,
    work_item_id=<this invocation's resolved target>, ...)` to obtain a
    fresh `owner_token`, then resume forward-completion or rollback per
    `evidence["outcome"]` at step 6a below using that token, skipping
    straight past steps 4c-6 (a taken-over transaction already has its
    journal open; never open a second one for it). A `None`
    `evidence["journal"]` means no transaction is open — proceed to 4c.
4c. **Plan stage only — open the failure-atomicity transaction**
    (`WF8c` items 347/349, the durable crash-resumable journal, this
    invocation's own first durable mutation, called before any Git
    staging and before any `WORKFLOW_STATE.json` write of any kind).
    `REJECTED`-bundle refusal, second of two, both stages (`WFR-67`):
    first re-call `workflow_fingerprint.assert_bundle_not_rejected(repo_root,
    work_item_id)` — a withdrawal landing between step 2 and here must
    still be caught. Read `docs/ai-workflow/WORKFLOW_STATE.json`'s
    current working-tree bytes fresh and parse them (`pre_state`). Build
    the record via step 4 above (`record`, `approval_now = <now>`) if not
    already built.

    **workflow-2.4.0, D-Plan-Amendment-4 — reconciliation inputs, read here
    and only here.** Call `metadata =
    workflow_fingerprint.resolve_plan_stage_metadata(repo_root,
    work_item_id)` -- one additional, cheap, idempotent resolver call, not
    a value inherited from an earlier step -- and read `metadata.plan_path`'s
    current working-tree bytes as `post_plan_text` and
    `metadata.registry_path`'s current working-tree bytes, parsed as JSON,
    as `post_registry`: the exact bytes the two-stage review just approved.
    When `pre_state`'s own `work_items[work_item_id]` has an open amendment
    (`amendment_history` non-empty and its last entry's
    `resolved_at_plan_revision` still `null`), also call `pre_plan_text,
    pre_registry = workflow_state.load_pre_amendment_snapshot(repo_root,
    work_item_id, metadata.plan_path, metadata.registry_path,
    amendment_history[-1])` -- never a re-read of the live
    `plan_path`/`registry_path`, which by this point in `AMENDING_PLAN`'s
    lifecycle already hold the *post*-amendment content. No open amendment:
    `pre_plan_text`/`pre_registry` stay `None`. All four values are read
    exactly once, at this call site, in this order, and forwarded verbatim
    into `open_plan_approval_journal` below -- never re-derived, and never
    consulted by this step itself.

    Then call
    `journal = workflow_state.open_plan_approval_journal(repo_root,
    work_item_id=work_item_id, base_commit=base_commit, pre_state=pre_state,
    record=record, approval_now=approval_now, expected_bundle_id=<step 2's
    bundle_id>, expected_review_content_id=<step 2's review_content_id>,
    applicable_paths=plan.paths, fifth_member_applies=<step 4a's resolved
    fifth member is not None>, fifth_member_sha256=<step 4a's pinned
    sha256 or None>, user_confirmation=<this turn's literal confirmation
    text>, quiescence_authorization="not required at the permanent site:

    (plan_approval_state_matches_pre_transaction) closes the concurrent-
    writer race the bootstrap's quiescence window instead bridges by
    convention", pre_registry=pre_registry, pre_plan_text=pre_plan_text,
    post_registry=post_registry, post_plan_text=post_plan_text)`.
    `owner_token = journal["owner_token"]`. Unlike the
    now-superseded prior revision of this step, **no**
    `docs/ai-workflow/WORKFLOW_STATE.json` working-tree write happens
    here or anywhere below — the transaction's expected post-approval
    bytes were already computed, once, pinned inside `journal` itself,
    and are never re-derived. (This is the one documented exception to
    this file's own top-of-file "State-writer discipline" paragraph: that
    paragraph's `state_transaction`/`state_lock` primitive protects the
    *ordinary* read-modify-write writers `D1`/item 354 enumerate; this
    specific write is durability-critical enough that `WFR-63` gives it
    its own dedicated, journal-backed transaction instead, verified by
    the freshness re-checks steps 6.2/6c run immediately before ever
    touching the file.)
5. **Plan stage only — stage every non-state approval member, then pin
   the fifth, if resolved** (guarded, ordinary,
   `step="step-5-stage-and-pin"`): inside
   `with workflow_state.plan_approval_guarded_mutation(repo_root,
   owner_token=owner_token, step="step-5-stage-and-pin", now=<now>):`,
   stage the plan doc, registry JSON, and mapping file, plus the fifth
   member if step 4a resolved one (step 4a's resolved set *minus*
   `docs/ai-workflow/WORKFLOW_STATE.json`) via **one** call to
   `workflow_state.stage_plan_approval_commit_paths(repo_root,
   ordinary_paths + ((fifth_member_path,) if fifth_member_path else
   ()))` — never `git add -A`/`git add .`, and never two separate calls.
   Fifth member resolved: immediately, inside this same window, call
   `workflow_state.verify_staged_blob_sha256(repo_root, fifth_member_path,
   pinned_sha256)` to close the race window between resolution and
   staging, before advancing progress. `StagedBlobMismatchError`/
   `DirtyIndexBeforeStagingError`/`UnexpectedStagedPathSetError` inside
   this window: let the exception propagate out of the `with` block (the
   guard still releases via its own `finally`, without advancing
   progress) straight to step 6b's rollback. No fifth member resolved:
   the same call, over the three ordinary members only, with no
   verification step after it. Implementation stage: not applicable.
6. **Plan stage only — create the approval commit**, two further
   guarded sub-steps plus one unguarded structural assertion:
   - **6.2 the state-pin compare-and-swap and pin** (guarded, ordinary,
     `step="step-6.1b-state-pin"`): **first**, `WF8c` item 348(gg)'s
     sub-step 6.1a compare-and-swap — call
     `workflow_state.plan_approval_state_matches_pre_transaction(repo_root,
     journal["pre_procedure_state_sha256"])`. `False` means
     `docs/ai-workflow/WORKFLOW_STATE.json`'s working-tree bytes have
     changed since the journal captured them (a legitimate concurrent
     `state_transaction` write, most likely) — raise inside the `with`
     block (never commit a post-state derived from superseded bytes) so
     the guard releases without advancing progress, then run step 6b's
     rollback and stop, reporting that the transaction was opened
     against now-stale state and must be retried fresh. `True`: call
     `blob_sha = workflow_state.pin_plan_approval_state_blob(repo_root,
     base64.b64decode(journal["expected_post_state_b64"]))` then
     `workflow_state.verify_staged_plan_approval_state_blob(repo_root,
     journal["expected_post_state_sha256"])` to close the race window
     between the pin and the commit.
   - **6.3 staged-set assertion** (unguarded, read-only): confirm the
     complete staged diff (`git diff --name-only --cached HEAD`) names no
     path outside `journal["applicable_paths"]` — a subset assertion,
     since a member byte-identical to `HEAD` legitimately produces no
     diff entry. A path outside the set: run step 6b's rollback and
     stop, naming it, rather than let a pathspec-free commit absorb it
     silently.
   - **6.4 the commit** (guarded, **destructive**,
     `step="step-6.5-commit"`): create **one plain, pathspec-free `git
     commit`** (no trailing `-- <paths>` — 6.3 already proved the index
     names no path outside the applicable set) carrying
     `Workflow-Plan-Approval: <full review_content_id>` +
     `Workflow-Work-Item: <id>` trailers. This command only writes the
     trailer; it never needs to search for one itself. The exact scoped
     trailer *lookup* later durability/freshness checks use is
     `workflow_state.discover_plan_approval_commit` (`WF4a-iii`). **These
     two lines must be the commit message's own final paragraph** — after
     any `Co-Authored-By:`/`Claude-Session:` lines, never before them
     (`OPUS-R129-001`): Git's `git interpret-trailers --parse`, the exact
     mechanism `discover_plan_approval_commit` uses, treats only the
     message's last paragraph as trailers, so a blank line after these
     two lines (e.g. one followed by `Co-Authored-By:`) silently discards
     both and makes the approval commit undiscoverable.

   Implementation stage: unchanged — a metadata-only commit (zero
   production/test changes) carrying `Workflow-Technical-Approval:
   <full review_content_id>` + `Workflow-Work-Item: <id>`, via the same
   direct `apply_technical_approval`/`state_transaction` write and plain
   `git commit` this stage has always used; none of 4b/4c/5/6.2-6.4/
   6a/6b/6c/6d below apply to it. **These two trailer lines must also be
   the commit message's own final paragraph** — after any
   `Co-Authored-By:`/`Claude-Session:` lines, never before them
   (`OPUS-R129-001`, the same rule `milestone-implement.md` step 1f,
   `bootstrap-workflow-v2.md` step 6, step 6.4 above, and
   `accept-milestone.md` step 6 already state): Git's `git
   interpret-trailers --parse` treats only the message's last paragraph
   as trailers, so a blank line after these two lines (e.g. one followed
   by `Co-Authored-By:`) silently discards both and makes the
   technical-approval commit undiscoverable. The exact scoped trailer
   lookup is `workflow_state.discover_technical_approval_commit`
   (`WF4a-iii`).

   **Implementation stage — post-commit verification of the commit this
   invocation just created** (workflow system audit, convergence pass 12,
   ledger row `I21`). The plan stage has step 6a's verification set; this
   stage had none, and its own dedicated validator had no live caller
   anywhere — implemented, documented and unit-tested, but never run, so a
   technical-approval commit that also mutated a *different* work item's
   entry or a top-level routing field, or that recorded
   `technical_approval` without transitioning `phase`, was accepted by
   every consumer. Immediately after the commit lands, call both:

   - `workflow_state.validate_technical_approval_commit(repo_root,
     <the new commit's SHA>, work_item_id)` — the exhaustive
     field-mutation check, the sibling
     `validate_bundle_generation_record_commit` has always applied to
     generation-record commits. It refuses via
     `MalformedTechnicalApprovalCommitError`, naming the offending fields
     or the other work item's id.
   - `workflow_state.verify_post_approval_manifest_match(repo_root,
     work_item, stage="implementation", base_commit=base_commit,
     commit=<the new commit's SHA>)` — the same post-approval identity
     re-verification step 6a runs for the plan stage.

   Both are applied **only to the commit this invocation just created**,
   never retroactively to discovered history: two technical-approval
   commits already in this repository predate the check and do not satisfy
   it (`9fd3c72` for `v2-1-dry-run`, which recorded the approval without a
   `phase` transition, and `ae51770` for `workflow-v2-1-core`, whose field
   set is wider than the contract), and history rewriting is not available
   — several such SHAs are pinned into `WORKFLOW_STATE.json` and approved
   bundles. Wiring the check into discovery instead would therefore have
   refused real, already-approved rounds; wiring it here constrains every
   commit this command creates from now on and re-judges nothing.

   On a failure: **stop**. The commit exists and must not be silently
   amended away — report the exact error, the commit SHA, and that the
   malformed commit needs human resolution before
   `AWAITING_FUNCTIONAL_REVIEW` can be trusted.
6a. **Plan stage only — classify the outcome from durable Git state**
    (`WF8c` items 347/350, never from this invocation's own exit status
    and never from `WORKFLOW_STATE.json`'s own content): call
    `outcome = workflow_state.classify_plan_approval_outcome(repo_root,
    journal)`.
    - **`COMMITTED`**: run the post-commit verification set —
      `workflow_state.verify_post_approval_manifest_match(repo_root,
      work_item, stage="plan", base_commit=base_commit, commit=<the new
      commit's SHA>)`; `workflow_state.assert_committed_path_set_matches(repo_root,
      commit, journal["applicable_paths"])`;
      `workflow_state.verify_committed_plan_approval_state_blob(repo_root,
      commit, journal["expected_post_state_sha256"])`; and, fifth member
      present, `workflow_state.verify_committed_blob_sha256(repo_root,
      commit, fifth_member_path, pinned_sha256)`. All pass: proceed to
      step 6c. Any one fails (only reachable via a genuine
      transaction-invariant violation — e.g. a `pre-commit`/`commit-msg`
      hook re-staging a file after step 5 through 6.3 ran but before `git commit`
      wrote the final tree, `WF8c` item 348(ff)/(nn)): run **6a1, amend
      recovery** (guarded, ordinary then destructive,
      `step="step-7b-amend-stage"` then `step="step-7d-amend-commit"`) —
      inside one `plan_approval_guarded_mutation(..., step=
      "step-7b-amend-stage", ...)` window, unconditionally re-run step 5's
      merged staging-and-pin in full and 6.2's compare-and-swap-and-pin
      (re-staging the *correct*, already-verified bytes is a harmless
      no-op for any member that was not actually corrupted); inside a second
      `plan_approval_guarded_mutation(..., step="step-7d-amend-commit",
      ...)` window, `git commit --amend --no-edit` (identical trailers,
      same parent, only the corrected tree differs); then re-run this
      same post-commit verification set against the amended SHA. Passes
      now: proceed to step 6c with the amended commit as "the" commit.
      Fails again: **stop and report** — never a second amend, never a
      second commit (`WF8c` item 348(jj)).
    - **`NOT_COMMITTED`**: run **6b, rollback** below, then stop.
    - **`AMBIGUOUS`**: **stop immediately** — report the journal's own
      identity and the live Git state (`HEAD`, whether a matching-trailer
      commit exists and what its parent is) side by side; never guess,
      never roll back, never forward-complete (`classify_plan_approval_outcome`'s
      own contract). This is a hard gate requiring human resolution; the
      journal is left exactly as found.
6b. **Plan stage only — rollback, on `NOT_COMMITTED` or any failure from
    step 5 through 6.3** (guarded, destructive, `step=
    "rollback-index-reset"`; deliberately **not**
    `plan_approval_guarded_mutation` — `rollback_plan_approval_transaction`
    already closes the journal and its own owner-progress record as part
    of a successful rollback, so advancing a progress record *after* the
    yield, the way every other guarded step above does, would write one
    for a transaction already gone): acquire the guard directly,
    `lease = workflow_state.acquire_plan_approval_guard(repo_root,
    holder_owner_token=owner_token, step="rollback-index-reset",
    now=<now>)`; inside a `try`/`finally` that releases it
    (`workflow_state.release_plan_approval_guard(repo_root, lease)`),
    call `workflow_state.rollback_plan_approval_transaction(repo_root,
    owner_token=owner_token)` — resets the whole index back to `HEAD`
    (working tree untouched), verifies the reset, and closes the
    journal; writes **zero** `docs/ai-workflow/WORKFLOW_STATE.json`
    bytes, since nothing was ever written to it in the first place.
    `PlanApprovalRollbackInvariantViolationError`/
    `PlanApprovalRollbackVerificationError`: stop and report — the
    journal is deliberately left in place rather than a claimed rollback
    going unverified. Report the *original* failure that triggered the
    rollback, not a generic one, once it completes. Implementation stage
    has no equivalent step — its write set was never widened by 4a, so
    its existing failure surface is unchanged.
6c. **Plan stage only — materialize** (guarded, destructive, `step=
    "step-8b-materialize"`, `WF8c` items 347/348(hh)/(mm), reached only
    from 6a's `COMMITTED` branch after verification passes): inside one
    `plan_approval_guarded_mutation(..., step="step-8b-materialize", ...)`
    window, decode `pre_state`/`post_state` from the journal's own
    `pre_procedure_state_b64`/`expected_post_state_b64` and call
    `target = workflow_state.classify_plan_approval_materialize_target(repo_root,
    work_item_id, pre_state, post_state)` — the target-scoped
    classification over *only* this work item's own `work_items` entry,
    so a different work item's legitimate concurrent write never factors
    into it.
    - `NOOP` (this work item's own entry already equals `post_state`'s —
      already materialized, or reconciled by hand): write nothing,
      proceed to step 6d.
    - `WRITE`: run the fresh, whole-file freshness re-check *immediately*
      before writing —
      `workflow_state.plan_approval_state_matches_pre_transaction(repo_root,
      journal["pre_procedure_state_sha256"])`. `True` (nothing else in
      the file has changed since journal-open): call
      `workflow_state.materialize_plan_approval_state(repo_root, commit,
      journal["expected_post_state_sha256"])`, then proceed to step 6d.
      `False` (a *different* work item's own entry was legitimately
      updated in the working tree between journal-open and now): **do
      not write** — the durable commit already exists and is not at
      risk, only this working-tree materialization is deferred. **Stop**
      without closing the journal; report that the approval commit
      landed at `<commit>` but the working-tree
      `docs/ai-workflow/WORKFLOW_STATE.json` could not be safely
      overwritten without discarding another work item's own concurrent
      change, and that re-running this command will re-observe the same
      `COMMITTED` outcome and either retry this same check (if the other
      change is still the only difference) or, once a human applies this
      work item's own entry from the commit onto the current file by
      hand, take the `NOOP` branch above and close the journal.
    - `PlanApprovalMaterializeDivergentEntryError` (this work item's
      *own* entry, not some other work item's, matches neither
      `pre_state` nor `post_state`): **stop** without closing the
      journal — something else wrote to this exact work item's own
      state between journal-open and now; no automatic reconciliation is
      safe to attempt. Report the divergence and require human
      resolution.
6d. **Plan stage only — close the journal** (guarded, destructive,
    `step="step-8a-close-journal"`, reached only after 6c's `NOOP` or
    `WRITE` branch succeeds): inside one final
    `plan_approval_guarded_mutation(..., step="step-8a-close-journal",
    ...)` window, call `workflow_state.close_plan_approval_journal(repo_root)`.
    Confirm the working tree is clean (`git status --porcelain` empty)
    immediately afterward — `WF8c` item 348(e).
7. Report the new phase (`IMPLEMENTING` or `AWAITING_FUNCTIONAL_REVIEW`) and
   **stop**. Never chain into the next state's actions in the same
   invocation.

   **workflow-2.4.0, D-Plan-Amendment-4 — report the reconciliation
   outcome (`IMPL6-B1`)**: plan stage only, and only when this
   invocation's own `apply_plan_approval` call resolved an amendment (step
   4c read a non-`None` `pre_registry`/`pre_plan_text` pair for it). Read
   `amendment_history[-1]["reconciliation_outcome"]` from the
   just-materialized `docs/ai-workflow/WORKFLOW_STATE.json` (the exact map
   `reconcile_checkpoints_after_amendment` returned, keyed by checkpoint
   id) and report it alongside the phase, by id: which ids were
   `retained`, which were demoted to `needs_revalidation` directly (their
   own registry row or checkpoint content changed) versus
   `needs_revalidation_dependency` (unchanged themselves, demoted only
   because a dependency was), which were `dropped`, and which are `new`.
   This is the operator-visible distinction between "reconciliation ran
   and legitimately did nothing" (every id `retained`) and "it never ran"
   (no amendment resolved this round, so this paragraph does not apply at
   all) -- never omit it for a round that did resolve an amendment, and
   never fabricate it by re-deriving from anything other than this exact
   field.
