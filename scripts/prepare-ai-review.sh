# work_items[work_item_id], both required by record_bundle_generation's
# contract (workflow_state.py, D-Approval-Commits' sole writer of both
# fields) before a bundle may be finalized for this head:
#
# 1. reviewed_implementation_head equals $HEAD_SHA, the exact commit this
#    generation run is for (GPT-R42-001) -- record_bundle_generation must
#    already have been called and persisted to the working tree
#    (committed or not) BEFORE this script runs, never after;
# 2. implementation_revision moved monotonically relative to the
#    PREVIOUS bundle already at $BUNDLE_DIR/MANIFEST.md, read here
#    before anything below can overwrite it (GPT-R43-001, corrected by
#    the salvage audit's ledger rows B1/B2/B3): regenerating for the
#    *same* generation head the previous manifest already named must
#    leave the revision unchanged (idempotent re-generation); at a *new*
#    generation head the revision must be either unchanged or exactly
#    one greater.
#
#    The original rule demanded "exactly one greater" at every new head.
#    That inference -- "a new generation head means a new reviewed
#    round" -- is false for both of this design's non-ordinary
#    generation modes, which exist precisely to move the generation head
#    while pinning the round: record_bundle_generation(...,
#    outcome="same_content") (WF8c (c)) and
#    /recover-implementation-provenance's own S2 commit (WF8c (b)) both
#    leave reviewed_implementation_head/implementation_revision
#    byte-identical by contract. Under the original rule neither could
#    ever publish its bundle, so both commands were unreachable end to
#    end.
#
#    The unchanged-revision case at a new head is admitted *only* when
#    check 1 above actually verified the provenance interval -- a
#    strictly stronger statement of round identity than any revision
#    delta: it proves live HEAD is exactly the current
#    Workflow-Bundle-Generation-Record commit T for the live
#    implementation_revision, that reviewed_implementation_head is
#    first-parent-reachable from T, that every non-record commit between
#    them classifies implementation-stage `excluded`, and that the
#    supersession chain is continuous. A round whose protected content
#    genuinely changed can never satisfy it
#    (ProtectedPathInProvenanceIntervalError), so nothing that the
#    original rule refused becomes reachable here.
#
#    `prev_head` is read from the previous manifest's `generation_head:`
#    line, not its `reviewed_implementation_head:` line: since the
#    salvage audit's ledger row I1 those are different values, and only
#    `generation_head` means "the commit that generation ran at" under
#    both the old and the new manifest semantics. The
#    `reviewed_implementation_head:` fallback below covers a manifest
#    predating `generation_head:` entirely, where the two were the same
#    value anyway.
#
#    A first-ever generation (no prior implementation-stage manifest to
#    compare against) skips this half, same skip condition as below.
#
# Skipped entirely for a work item with no WORKFLOW_STATE.json entry, same
# skip condition as the "record_bundle_generation" step this bundle
# generation precedes (docs/ai-workflow/REVIEW_PROTOCOL.md), and for the
# plan stage / a flat-compatibility (no work-item-id) invocation, which
# this guard does not govern.

# amendment_history's last entry is still open (resolved_at_plan_revision is
# still null). Written to $ROOT_DIR/AMENDMENT_DIFF.patch -- a sibling of
# $BUNDLE_DIR ("current"), never a descendant of it -- so it participates in
# neither bundle_id nor review_content_id (both walk only $BUNDLE_DIR).
# Regenerated unconditionally on every plan-stage generation, and deleted
# when no amendment is open, so a bundle regenerated after the amendment
# closes never leaves a stale copy sitting next to a fresh "current/". No
# governing-version awareness -- this applies identically regardless of
# which of the two plan-review protocols the work item follows.
#
# In practice this point is only ever reached once the PLAN_STAGE_BASE_CHECK
# block above has already resolved this exact work item's plan-stage
# metadata successfully (which itself requires docs/ai-workflow/
# WORKFLOW_STATE.json to exist, parse, and carry this work item's entry --
# any failure there reports "error::" and exits 1 before this point), so an
# absent or unparseable state file is already provably unreachable here
# today. The read below is still wrapped defensively (OPUS-R145-004): this
# block runs unconditionally for every plan-stage generation, including the
# overwhelming majority of work items that will never amend, so a later,
# independent change to either guard must not turn a merely
# reviewer-convenience file into a hard failure for those work items.
# Only the state-file read/parse above is wrapped (IMPL4-O1 review round:
# the previous wording here overstated this) -- a failure there degenerates
# to "no amendment is open" (delete any stale copy, write nothing), the
# same conservative, fail-toward-absent direction
# `parse_checkpoint_anchor_spans`'s own non-strict mode already takes for
# the pre side of this same mechanism. Once `is_open` is True, the branch
# below (`resolve_plan_stage_metadata`, the `amendment_base_commit` read,
# the `git diff` subprocess) is *not* similarly wrapped: an exception there
# propagates out of the heredoc, `python3` exits non-zero, and `set -euo
# pipefail` (line 19) aborts this entire script -- the same hard-failure
# path every other unrecovered error in this file already takes, not a
# silent "no amendment is open" degradation. This is deliberately not
# widened to a broad `try/except Exception` around the whole branch: a
# genuine amendment-diff generation failure for a work item that *does*
# have an open amendment is exactly the class of error a reviewer needs to
# see, not one this reviewer-convenience file should paper over.

# generator-side stage-document binding, parts 3/3b): when a manifest was
# written above, require bundle_id equality across three independent
# computations -- the value MANIFEST.md itself declares, a fresh
# recomputation directly over $BUNDLE_DIR, and a fresh recomputation over
# the archive's own extracted content -- plus, for the plan stage, the
# fourth byte-identity assertion (PLAN.md/files/archive vs. the pinned
# plan_path snapshot) -- so a stale or non-reproducible artifact fails
# closed here instead of being discovered only by an external reviewer's
# own independent recomputation. On failure, for a scoped work item, this
# withdraws the bundle (REJECTED marker, ordered removal, quarantine)
# rather than leaving a stale-but-self-verifying current/ and archive in
# place; on success, it clears any pre-existing REJECTED marker.
#
# Gated on $MANIFEST_WRITTEN -- this invocation's own producer state --
# never on `-f "$BUNDLE_DIR/MANIFEST.md"` (convergence pass 12, ledger
# I20). Two of this script's four stages write no manifest at all
# (`functional-review` at either layout, and `implementation`/`post-fix`
# with the work-item-id omitted), and $BUNDLE_DIR is a directory reused
# across stages by design: a `functional-review` generation over a work
# item whose plan- or implementation-stage round already published there
# found that round's MANIFEST.md still sitting in the directory, ran the
# three-way check against it, and could only ever fail -- CHANGED_FILES.txt
# alone carries a `stage:` line this run has just rewritten, so the
# recomputed bundle_id disagrees with the recorded one by construction.
# The failure path is `withdraw_bundle`, so a *valid, published, already-
# approved* bundle was quarantined and its archive deleted by a generation
# that never claimed the bundle's identity in the first place -- with
# WORKFLOW_STATE.json left untouched (this script is not a state writer),
# so `technical_approval` stayed CURRENT over a bundle that no longer
# existed, and the completed withdrawal removed its own REJECTED marker on
# the way out, leaving `assert_bundle_not_rejected` with nothing to see.
#
# The invariant this restores: finalization is a *producer's* obligation.
# A run that generated an identity must prove that identity reproduces; a
# run that generated none has nothing to prove, and no standing to
# withdraw another round's artifact. Deleting the stale manifest to
# suppress the check would be the same filesystem-state reasoning
# inverted, and would additionally destroy the published round's own
# identity record; the flag is the producer state itself.
