"""Workflow v2.1 state-file schema and validator core (WF1a), extended
with work-item routing and the registry/mapping generator (WF1b), D2/
D-States' approval-record schema and gate logic (WF4a-ii), and the
approval/checkpoint-completion Git-lifecycle mechanics (WF4a-iii).

Implements the `docs/ai-workflow/WORKFLOW_V2_PLAN.md` D3 schema for
`docs/ai-workflow/WORKFLOW_CONFIG.json` (repository-level default,
pre-activation fail-safe, `supported_versions` enforcement),
`docs/ai-workflow/WORKFLOW_STATE.json` (multi-item work-item map,
`checkpoints` map as the sole writable checkpoint-status record), the
local-only `.ai-review/runtime/WORKTREE_IDENTITY.json` schema (D3;
its writer is WF2, not built here), and D-Commit-Provenance's exact,
scoped, ancestry-limited `Workflow-Checkpoint`/`Workflow-Work-Item`
trailer search with its duplicate-trailer tie-break.

WF1b adds D1's work-item routing (create-or-resume semantics for
`/milestone-plan`, completion/reset), and D-Registry/D4b's registry/
mapping JSON generator (the sole writer either file should ever have,
running the coverage/topological-order checks at generation time rather
than leaving them to be discovered at review time).

WF4a-ii adds D2's unified `plan_approval`/`technical_approval` record
schema, the non-circular gate-reachability check for both new D-States
gates (`AWAITING_PLAN_APPROVAL`/`AWAITING_TECHNICAL_APPROVAL`), the
EXTERNAL_APPROVE/USER_OVERRIDE basis decision, and the mechanism-
independent user-only guard's second control (literal, specific
`user_confirmation` text).

WF4a-iii adds D-Commit-Provenance's trailer search generalized beyond
checkpoint trailers to the `Workflow-Plan-Approval`/
`Workflow-Technical-Approval` trailers `/approve-review` creates
(`discover_approval_commits`, sharing the same first-parent-ancestor
tie-break and genuine-ambiguity recovery as `discover_checkpoint_commits`
via one private helper), D-States' "Recomputation rule, stated per
stage" (`approval_review_content_id`/`approval_is_current`, resolving
`OPUS-R6-003`'s self-invalidation defect), the full `IMPLEMENTING` entry
condition D-Approval-Commits names (`implementing_entry_reachable`:
ancestry to the discovered plan-approval commit, plus freshness), the
"no protected path is dirty" gate condition's actual Git-derived boolean
(`any_protected_path_dirty`, consumed by WF4a-ii's own
`technical_approval_gate_reachable`), and WFR-06's post-approval-commit
manifest-match verification (`verify_post_approval_manifest_match`).
WF4a-iv adds the two-stage local-then-manual-external plan-review
protocol's own ledger writers (D-Plan-Review-Stages): `record_local_plan_review`/
`record_manual_plan_review` implement the six-row verdict/state transition
table (`/review-plan`'s and `/record-manual-plan-review`'s sole state
write set, resolving `GPT-R12-001/002/003`), each guarded by its own
precondition validator (`WrongGoverningVersionForPlanReviewStageError`,
`WrongPhaseForPlanReviewStageError`, `StaleReviewContentIdError` (hard),
`WrongReviewerRoleError`, `MissingLocalApprovalForManualStageError`,
`DuplicateManualStageIngestionError`); `check_manual_stage_bundle_id_advisory`
implements the manual stage's advisory-only (never blocking) `bundle_id`
mismatch warning (`OPUS-R14-005`); `transition_to_awaiting_local_plan_review`
implements `/apply-plan-review`'s `"2.1"`-only revised exit step (D-Plan-
Review-Stages, resolves `GPT-R11-003`/`-007`) -- the sole writer that
re-enters `AWAITING_LOCAL_PLAN_REVIEW` after an accepted plan edit, at
either stage's `REVISE` origin, since the recomputation rule already makes
a prior stage's ledger entry read as stale the moment the edit changes
`review_content_id` (no explicit ledger clear needed). Still not this
checkpoint's concern: `/approve-review`'s own commit-creation step (the
Claude session running `git commit` per `.claude/commands/approve-review.md`,
never a Python-side commit writer, consistent with this module's decide-
and-validate-only design).

WF2 adds D-Selection's deterministic four-rule checkpoint-selection
algorithm (`select_next_checkpoint`), the `IN_PROGRESS`/`COMPLETE` state
writers (`transition_checkpoint_in_progress`/`complete_checkpoint`,
implementing checkpoint-complete-vs-all-complete semantics), and D3's
worktree-scoped dirty-resume mechanics: `write_worktree_identity` (the
named writer for `.ai-review/runtime/WORKTREE_IDENTITY.json`, previously
schema-only) and its read-side counterpart `verify_dirty_resume_safety`.

WF4c adds D-Functional-Remediation's general functional-remediation cycle:
`mark_technical_approval_stale` (the bounded-code-change branch's
stale-before-edit write, persisted before the first source/test edit) and
`record_bundle_generation` (`reviewed_implementation_head`'s sole writer,
closing the loop `OPUS-R6-013` found -- nothing wrote this field before,
so `AWAITING_TECHNICAL_APPROVAL`'s entry condition was unreachable for any
real `"2.1"` item; wired into the bundle generator at exactly the
`"implementation"`/`"post-fix"` stage). `create_remediation_child_work_item`
implements the broad/multi-finding branch: a distinct child work item
(`"<parent>-remediation-<n>"`, `n` derived deterministically, never
caller-supplied) with its own registry/mapping/approval lifecycle,
routed through the ordinary commands from there, never mutating the
parent's own registry/mapping/completed-checkpoint history.
`incomplete_children`/`complete_work_item`'s extended check implement
"parent acceptance blocks on an incomplete child" (resolves `GPT-R9-016`).

WF8b adds the first production slice of `D-Checkpoint-Ownership`
(revisions 69-72 of the plan's "The origination reference" and "The read
fails closed, and the partition is total"): `checkpoint_origination_provable`
and its supporting `origination_reference_commits`/
`_checkpoint_status_at_commit`, scanning every commit
`git rev-list --all --full-history -- <state path>` enumerates for a
decidable observation that a checkpoint's `IN_PROGRESS` was ever supplied
by a checkout, merge, or reset rather than genuinely originated in this
worktree. Wired into `/milestone-implement`'s `[2.1 step 1]` step 1c,
alongside `verify_dirty_resume_safety`, on the resume path only.

A second WF8b slice adds "The record" and "Fencing: the mutation/handoff
guard" (revisions 63-72), plus the explicit takeover and the abandoned-
guard recovery it depends on: the shared, never-committed claim record
under `$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/ai-workflow/checkpoint-claims/`
(`claim_checkpoint`/`resolve_claim`/`observe_claim`/`release_checkpoint`,
atomic `os.link`/`os.rename` publication, symlink/directory/EACCES all
failing closed rather than reading as absent), the per-work-item mutation/
handoff guard (`acquire_guard`/`assert_claim_owner`/`owner_mutation`'s one
fixed acquire-assert-mutate-release window, `GPT-R81-001`'s fenced
handoff), the observation-bound, evidence-first explicit takeover
(`takeover_evidence`/`take_over_claim`), and the distinct abandoned-
`"destructive"`-guard recovery for a holder worktree that no longer
exists (`recover_abandoned_destructive_guard`, `OPUS-R82-001`) -- gated
on `git worktree list`, never on a timeout or a liveness guess. Also
fixes `OPUS-R86-002`'s `WORKTREE_IDENTITY.json` lost-update defect
(12/12 threaded trials lost an entry under the prior plain read-modify-
write): `write_worktree_identity` now serializes its whole load-validate-
mutate-publish sequence under `identity_document_lock`
(`.ai-review/runtime/WORKTREE_IDENTITY.lock`, a stable, never-unlinked,
per-worktree `fcntl.flock` leaf) and publishes by a single `os.replace`
(`_publish_worktree_identity`, `OPUS-R86-005`); `repair_worktree_identity`
is the authorized repair-by-overwrite a rotating operation uses when the
taking worktree's own identity document is undecidable
(`OPUS-R86-003`/`-004`).

A third WF8b slice adds `adopt_claim` ("Reconciling the two authorities",
revisions 63-72): the one-time migration path for a checkpoint
interrupted before this mechanism existed, publishing a claim for a
checkpoint this worktree already holds `IN_PROGRESS` -- guarded by the
same origination reference the first slice built
(`checkpoint_origination_provable`, re-evaluated a second time at
publication under `guard_mutation_lock`), never by the dry-run
prototype's superseded `committed_checkpoint_status`-only check.

A fourth WF8b slice adds `/milestone-implement`'s own step 1c/1d/1f
wiring ("Where the check belongs, and the ordering"):
`resolve_checkpoint_ownership` (the full "Reconciling the two
authorities" table -- RESUME/FRESH/CONTINUE_CLAIM/NO_CHECKPOINT, the
foreign-claim refusal, the adopt-then-resume branch, the single
automatic release, and the two defensive mismatch refusals) and
`_attach_ownership_evidence`/`_ownership_escape_hint`, which annotate
every refusal 1c raises with `.ownership_evidence` unconditionally,
including on an absent claim, plus origination-specific evidence
components for `CheckpointOriginationUnprovableError` specifically.

A fifth WF8b slice adds `WFR-66`'s identity-query enforcement: the
identity queries' own read partition (`_identity_query_at_commit`/
`_scan_identity_reference`, distinct from and disjoint with the
origination test's own partition, though both scan the same reference),
the two permanent, unescapable observed-id refusals
(`WorkItemIdReusedError`/`CheckpointIdReusedError`, wired into
`route_work_item`'s fresh-id branch and `write_registry_and_mapping`'s
delta-scoped checkpoint-id check), and the evidence-bound,
non-replayable, repository-serialized escape from the undecidable case
(`authorize_identity_reference_gap`, `recover_abandoned_destructive_
guard`'s own signature) with its durable record under
`$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/ai-workflow/identity-gap-authorizations/`.

Deliberately still bounded: no WFR-66 enforcement wired into any
`.claude/commands/*.md` operator flow beyond the two library call sites
above, and executing `v2-1-dry-run`'s `S14`/`S15` scenarios for real
against this design remains future `WF8b` scope.

Stdlib-only, mirroring `scripts/workflow_fingerprint.py`'s own
`docs/TECHNICAL_DECISIONS.md`-recorded constraint.

    role-specific predicate narrows further -- exactly one verified

    candidates together, not just the one commit being tested --
    `_bundle_generation_record_chain_tip` (WF8c (c)/(b)) needs this to

    committed state does not record whatever `verify` would have checked.
    `WF0` is the live instance this is true and expected for (its
    completion commit predates `WORKFLOW_STATE.json`'s own existence, so
    no committed state could ever record it `COMPLETE`) -- `WF0` still
    resolves at 1 candidate / 0 verified, correctly. The property is
    general, not `WF0`-specific, and deliberately not tightened into a
    post-resolution assertion here: doing so would need an explicit
    legacy exemption for `WF0` (and any future single-commit, pre-state

    is a **required** keyword argument, not an optional cross-check: the
    journal is a single, repository-wide object (`.ai-review/runtime/
    PLAN_APPROVAL_JOURNAL.json`), so `/approve-review B plan` observes an
    interrupted transaction belonging to work item A exactly as readily as
    one of its own, and every step from `6a` onward then drives A's pinned
    record, A's paths and A's expected post-state under B's invocation
    (convergence repair, optional finding 3). Nothing else refused that:
    the authorization literal names A, but naming A is not the same as
    checking that the operator meant A. An optional argument would leave
    the same forget-to-pass-it hole this repair exists to close, so the
    argument is required and the mismatch is refused at step 1a, before
    the claim, the guard, or any rotation -- having mutated nothing.

    1. **Observe** -- `plan_approval_takeover_evidence`.
    1a. **Target** -- the open journal's own `work_item_id` must equal the
       caller's resolved `work_item_id`; otherwise
       `PlanApprovalTakeoverWorkItemMismatchError`, naming both.
    2. **Authorize** -- the literal must be exactly
       `plan_approval_takeover_authorization_literal(evidence)`. When a
       guard was observed, a separate guard-release authorization quoting
       its `lease_id`/`step`/`step_class` is required too, and a
       `"destructive"` guard is refused outright -- no wording of an
       authorization changes that.
    3. **Claim, exclusively** -- `os.link` the journal onto
       `PLAN_APPROVAL_JOURNAL.claim.<T>`, scoping this attempt to the one
       observed epoch; a live concurrent takeover of the same epoch
       refuses here, having mutated nothing. A claim left by a takeover
       attempt that died before rotating (the journal still carries `T`)
       is provably dead and is cleared, once, before retrying.
    3a. **Acquire the mutation guard** -- the same primitive every
        mutating step acquires, `step="takeover"`, `step_class="ordinary"`.
    4. **Re-verify under the guard** -- the journal's `owner_token` and
       the progress record's `step_seq`/`updated_at` must be exactly the
       values the authorization quoted; either having advanced proves the
       owner is live: refuse, mutate nothing.
    5. **Rotate, still under the guard** -- every journal field carried
       over byte-identically except `owner_token` (fresh), `takeover_count`

# (`D-Approval-Commits` revision 56's "no intermediate state can satisfy the
# currently-installed `/bootstrap-workflow-v2`'s own durability guard": the
# post-approval state is pinned into the Git index and materialized into the

# working-tree copy of `WORKFLOW_STATE.json` never shows post-approval bytes
# before there is a commit to back them).
#
# `pin_plan_approval_state_blob` deliberately does not use
# `stage_plan_approval_commit_paths`'s ordinary `git add` (which always
# reads the working tree): it writes the journal's own pinned
# `expected_post_state_b64` bytes as a Git blob object
# (`git hash-object -w --stdin`) and stages that blob directly into the
# index (`git update-index --cacheinfo`), leaving the working-tree file
# byte-identical to `HEAD` throughout. `materialize_plan_approval_state`
# is the one and only later write to that file's working-tree copy,
# performed from the approval commit's own committed bytes, never a fresh
# re-serialization -- so what lands on disk is always exactly what the
# commit already carries.

# redesign specifically requires: staged (`verify_staged_plan_approval_state_blob`),
# committed (`verify_committed_plan_approval_state_blob`), and materialized
# (`materialize_plan_approval_state`'s own post-write re-read). Deliberately
# bounded to this part: these are library primitives only, exercised
# directly against real `ScratchRepo` git history -- the caller that will
# wrap each in `plan_approval_guarded_mutation(..., step="step-6.1b-state-pin"

    pass" distinction `/approve-review plan`'s own report (see
    `apply_plan_approval`) requires and that a single shared token could

    above recorded for that same id (a closure-derived demotion always
    supersedes a direct one in the report, since the closure pass runs
    strictly after and the id's `status` ends at `NEEDS_REVALIDATION`
    either way). No fixed-point loop needed, since every dependency
    precedes its dependents in that order (B6.3) -- a precondition this

      This clause used to add that `complete_checkpoint` "already does
      this the moment the last checkpoint completes, so a caller only ever

    convergence pass 7).

    Before this existed, `complete_checkpoint` above was the phase's sole
    writer, reachable only as a side effect of a checkpoint *transitioning*
    to `COMPLETE`. Both commands' wrap-up branches say "enter
    `SELF_REVIEWING_IMPLEMENTATION`" in prose and named no state writer at
    all, which is invisible on the ordinary path -- the branch is entered
    on the invocation *after* the last checkpoint completed, when
    `complete_checkpoint` has already written the phase -- but wedges the
    work item permanently the moment the branch is entered from a real
    `IMPLEMENTING`: a plan re-approval (`apply_plan_approval`, which sets
    `IMPLEMENTING` unconditionally and correctly) on an item whose every
    registry checkpoint is already `COMPLETE`. `select_next_checkpoint`
    then returns `None`, `resolve_checkpoint_ownership` returns

    - `phase == "SELF_REVIEWING_IMPLEMENTATION"` already: **returns the
      input state unchanged**, with no `state_revision` bump and no
      `last_transition` rewrite. This is the ordinary path's own case, and
      it must stay a true no-op -- the wrap-up branch is re-entered on
      every subsequent invocation until the bundle is generated, and a
      writer that bumped the revision each time would manufacture a state
      change out of a read-only re-check.
    - `phase == "IMPLEMENTING"` and every checkpoint named in `registry`
      is `COMPLETE`: writes the transition, bumps `state_revision`, sets
      `last_transition`. Same all-complete predicate `complete_checkpoint`
      applies, deliberately re-derived from `registry` rather than trusted
      from any stored phase value.
    - `phase == "IMPLEMENTING"` with an outstanding checkpoint:
      `IncompleteCheckpointsForSelfReviewError`, naming it. There is real
      work left; the caller must implement it, not skip it.

# guard" in docs/ai-workflow/WORKFLOW_V2_PLAN.md, revisions 63-72),
# plus the explicit takeover and the abandoned-guard recovery it depends

# dry-run prototype (docs/ai-workflow/dry-run/wf8b-s14-repro/
# checkpoint_ownership.py) is reference/reproduction evidence only.
#
# Scope, deliberately bounded per this session's own direction, continuing
# the prior session's origination-reference slice: no `resolve_ownership`/
# `classify_selection` (the `/milestone-implement` step 1c/1d/1f wiring
# lives under "Where the check belongs, and the ordering"), and no
# `WFR-66` identity-query enforcement (a distinct implementation surface,
# `authorize_identity_reference_gap`). Those remain future WF8b scope.
# `adopt_claim` itself ("Reconciling the two authorities") is defined
# further below, after the claim-publication and mutation-guard
# primitives it composes. This slice makes
# `take_over_claim`/`recover_abandoned_destructive_guard`/`adopt_claim`
# available and independently tested, which is the prerequisite the plan
# names for actually taking `v2-1-dry-run`'s interrupted `S-CP3` over for
# real.

    (`XMODEL-R9-B1`). (9) is rooted at the git common dir, so it
    serializes this publication against `request_plan_amendment_transaction`
    in *every* linked worktree; and the witness, readable from every
    worktree, refuses the claim while an amendment is `OPEN` or its

    registered work item's current phase (re-read fresh, under the lock,
    never from a caller-supplied snapshot) is not legal for a checkpoint
    start. A work item with no `WORKFLOW_STATE.json` entry skips the phase
    check (no amendment mechanism races it), but never the witness check.

    `adopt_claim` and `take_over_claim` of an absent claim publish a

# workflow-2.6.0, `D-Repo-Global-Lifecycle` (CP6; closes `v2.4.0-002`):
# the repository-global lifecycle lock (primitive (9)) and the amendment
# witness.
#
# `v2.4.0-002` had two independent causes: `WORKFLOW_STATE.lock` is
# per-worktree, so an amendment in worktree A and a claim in worktree B
# were never serialized; and `claim_checkpoint` read only its own
# worktree's state, so an `AMENDING_PLAN` committed on A's branch was
# invisible from B. This section closes both with two repository-global
# objects under `<git-common-dir>/ai-workflow/checkpoint-claims/`:
#
# - `<token>.lifecycle.lock`, a per-work-item `fcntl.flock` that is never
#   unlinked (the same shape as `guard_mutation_lock`). It serializes every
#   claim publication, every amendment request and every resolution
#   reservation/advance/release for the work item, in every worktree. It is
#   a *pure source*: acquired only while this process holds no other
#   primitive (`_held_primitives`), and never held across turns.
# - `<token>.amendment.json`, the amendment witness: which amendment
#   sequence is `OPEN`, `RESOLVING` (reserved by one resolver),
#   `RESOLVED` (with the one resolution digest that is repository-valid),
#   or `NONE` (never amended). Written by tempfile plus `os.replace`,
#   advanced and rolled back but never deleted in ordinary operation. It is
#   a gate, not an authority: it can only cause refusals, and committed Git
#   state stays authoritative for every fact it records.
#
# Every holder of (9) first runs the mixed-release lag probe, then the
# fixed predicate list (`_evaluate_lifecycle`), then its own side's checks.
# The plan's section 5.6 is the normative text; the names below follow it.

    """The type-appropriate `implementation_stage` half of
    `generate_artifacts_declarations`' template (salvage audit `B4`).

    Before this, the generated half named nothing but the declarations
    file protecting itself -- `protected_prefixes`/`excluded_paths`/
    `excluded_prefixes` were all empty -- so the *first*
    implementation-stage computation for any freshly created work item
    raised `UnclassifiedPathError` on the item's own deliverable, after
    the plan-approval hard gate. The generator was also never given
    `work_item_type`, so it could not have emitted a type-appropriate set
    even in principle.

    What the template classifies, and deliberately what it does not:

    - **protected**: this file itself (unchanged self-protection), plus
      the deliverable tree this `work_item_type` owns
      (`IMPLEMENTATION_STAGE_DELIVERABLE_PREFIXES`).
    - **excluded**: every path this workflow's own commands are
      *guaranteed* to write for any work item (`_WORKFLOW_MACHINERY_*`),
      this item's own three plan-stage declaration paths, the repository
      housekeeping/product-brief documents the plan stage's own closed set
      already names, and the *other* `work_item_type`'s deliverable tree
      and documentation territory.
    - **neither**: everything else, which still fails closed via
      `UnclassifiedPathError` -- any path under a directory the template
      does not name at all.

    The one judgment the template *does* make rather than defer is
    `docs/ai-workflow/` (salvage audit `B7`): excluded at both stages,
    because everything under it is either this workflow's own bookkeeping
    or *another* work item's plan-stage content, owned and bound by
    whichever item declares it. Leaving it unclassified instead was tried
    and is worse: it makes two concurrent work items -- `D1`'s normal
    case -- impossible without hand-enumerating every sibling's plan
    document in every new declaration, which is exactly what every real
    work item in this repository ended up doing, one of them missing a
    sibling and being caught only at plan review. A `process` item whose
    deliverable genuinely *is* a workflow design document under this
    prefix must move that exact path into
    `implementation_stage.protected_paths` during `SELF_REVIEWING_PLAN`,

    item under `work_items[id]`. Returns a new state dict (does not mutate
    the input, so a caller can inspect the pre-route state on failure).

    - A fresh id creates a new `work_items[id]` entry, fixing
      `governing_workflow_version` from the config's current
      `default_workflow_version` (validated against `supported_versions`,
      `OPUS-R6-024`) and never re-read afterward.
    - An id naming an existing *non-terminal* entry resumes it: only
      `plan_revision`/`state_revision`/`last_transition` advance
      unconditionally -- identity fields (`work_item_type`/`kind`/
      `governing_workflow_version`/`parent_work_item_id`) are immutable
      after creation. **`mapping_path`/`base_commit`, and now
      `plan_path`/`registry_path` too, on the resume branch** (new,
      `D-Fingerprint-Generalization`, `OPUS-R28-002`): for each of the
      four declaration facts, independently, if the stored value is
      `null` and a non-null argument is supplied here, it is written; if
      the stored value is non-null and the supplied argument disagrees,
      `WorkItemDeclarationFactConflictError` (a declaration fact is
      immutable once set); if no argument is supplied for a field, that
      field is left untouched. This makes the resume branch usable for a
      pre-declared, non-terminal entry that has some or all of these four
      facts still `null` (e.g. `v2-1-dry-run`, created with only
      `plan_path` set) -- the same call this function's caller makes for
      a fresh id also works, idempotently, for a resumed one.
    - A fresh id is stamped `feedback_layout: "scoped"`
      (`D-Feedback-Layout`, workflow-2.6.0); the resume branch never
      writes that field.
    - An id naming an existing *terminal* entry is a hard error: ids are
      not reused after `MILESTONE_COMPLETE`.
    - **For a `TWO_STAGE_PLAN_REVIEW_VERSIONS` item, the resume branch runs
      only at `PLANNING`, `REVISING_PLAN` or `AMENDING_PLAN`**
      (`D-Plan-Review-Bundle-Binding`, workflow-2.6.0, `LPR-R4-002`): at a
      ready phase it refuses with `PlanReviewInProgressError`, at any other
      phase with `PlanReviewPhaseNotPlanStageError`, before any write. A
      `"1"`-governed item is unchanged.
    - `active_work_item_id` is set to this id only if no other item is
      currently active (or this item already is) -- routing never steals
      focus from unrelated in-flight, non-terminal work (D1's "resume-focus
      pointer, not an execution lock").
    - **A fresh id is additionally checked against `D-Checkpoint-Ownership`'s
      origination reference** (new, revision 71, `OPUS-R88-004`): an id
      that has ever appeared there is permanently non-reusable, refused
      with `WorkItemIdReusedError` -- a stronger, historical check than
      the terminal-phase one above, which only ever sees *live* state.
      This check runs only when `repo_root` is supplied; a caller that
      omits it gets the unchanged, repo-independent routing this function
      always had (an in-memory/testing convenience, never the production
      call site's own path). An undecidable reference read raises
      `IdentityReferenceUndecidableError`, cleared only by the explicit

# Deliberately scoped to a **fixed named roster**, not "every tracked
# `.claude/commands/*.md` file" the way `discover_state_writers`' own
# `STATE_WRITER_SURFACE_PREFIXES` scans its whole prefix: `WFR-67`'s own
# revision-80 text named an exact, closed set of thirteen files (nine
# bundle/verdict consumers, four exempt). The roster is a deliberately
# extended list, not eternally frozen at that revision-80 snapshot: two
# later command files -- `.claude/commands/review-implementation.md` and
# `.claude/commands/review-functional.md` (`workflow-v2-3` CP1/CP2), both
# bundle-report consumers -- were added when they were built, bringing the
# roster to fifteen files (eleven bundle/verdict consumers, four exempt).
# Retiring `/accept-scoped-remediation` (ledger `I10`) removed one exempt
# entry, leaving the roster at its current fourteen files (eleven bundle/
# verdict consumers, three exempt): a deleted command file cannot carry a
# declaration, and leaving it on the roster would make the discovery
# function refuse for a file that no longer exists. Adding a file here is a
# deliberate per-command decision at the time that command is written, not
# automatic for everything that postdates any prior snapshot.
# `.claude/commands/recover-implementation-provenance.md` (added earlier,
# `WF8c` item (b)) was considered and left
# off: it is a `state_writer: true` recovery action, and its classification
# against `WFR-67`'s roster is deliberately left unassigned rather than
# resolved -- its own step 6 does read `<bundle_dir>/MANIFEST.md`'s existing
# `stage:` field over a bundle directory it did not itself generate, which
# reaches the middle of the three semantic disjuncts, so whether it belongs
# in the roster at all is the same "re-derive from this file's own prose
# against the three semantic disjuncts" judgment call this function's own
# docstring already defers, not something a scan-everything default should
# decide by silently demanding a declaration this roster's own history
# never assigned it.
#
# This discovery function covers the *declaration* half only. WFR-67's own
# text additionally requires the declaration to be "cross-checked against
# the three semantic disjuncts and against the presence of the shared
# assertion" -- deriving each file's expected value from its own prose
# (does it read `REVIEW_FEEDBACK.md`? recompute/compare `bundle_id`?
# present a bundle as ready for review?) and confirming
# `workflow_fingerprint.assert_bundle_not_rejected` actually appears at the
# right points. That derivation is separate, deferred `WF8c` scope; this
# function and its conformance test instead pin the **known-correct**
# classification (the eleven consumers/three exempt split over the current
# fourteen-file roster above -- nine/four over thirteen files at `WFR-67`'s
# own revision-80 text, extended since) as an explicit expected-value
# table, so a file that drifts from it is still caught, even though the
# check is against a recorded table rather than re-derived from first
# principles.

        defect class, one level up from what this conformance protects
        against here);
    (b1) no open, undischarged item names an already-`COMPLETE` checkpoint
         as its owner;
    (b2) every open, undischarged item names a real, reachable,
         non-`COMPLETE` registry owner, unless its status is `SUPERSEDED`
         (owner `none` -- whether the design section it tests is genuinely
         superseded is a plan-text judgment call this mechanism does not
         re-litigate);

    "Discharged" (`OPUS-R129-003`): an item the reconciliation table
    itself still marks `ABSENT`/`PARTIAL` forever -- `WF8c`'s own
    resolution rule (revision 88, `OPUS-R110-001`) closes such an item by
    a recorded, re-executable evidence reference, never by flipping the
    table's frozen text to `IMPLEMENTED` -- so once its owning checkpoint
    finishes, the item is legitimately no longer *live* open work, even
    though the table's status column never changes (a fresh plan revision
    is the only thing that ever could). A discharged item is excluded from
    all three clauses here. Discharge means only "an evidence reference is
    recorded" (`_reconciliation_evidence_ids_at_commit`); it does not
    re-execute it -- re-execution green-ness is `WFO-LEDGER-COVERAGE`'s
    own separately-verified, non-duplicated property (ii)
    (`verify_wfo_ledger_coverage`/`_pre_flight_wfo_ledger_coverage`, which
    already gate checkpoint completion and technical approval on it). An
    item with no recorded evidence is never discharged and still fails
    (a)/(b1)/(b2) exactly as before once its owner completes -- the real
    staleness/omission bug these clauses exist to catch.
    (c) the reconciliation table's own upper bound tracks the 'Missing
        tests' list's highest item, so adding an item without extending
        the table's range fails closed rather than silently orphaning it;
    (d) `WFR-63`'s own `checkpoint_ids` -- the plan's worked example for
        this clause, unchanged since revision 59 -- still names the live
        umbrella owner alongside its historical `WF4a-iii` entry, so its

    `OPUS-R133-001`/`-002` found the previous `git status --porcelain`-
    based version of this check trusted the checkout's own `.git/` state:
    a clone-local `core.hooksPath`, or a matched clean/smudge filter pair
    registered via `.git/info/attributes`, could make `git status` report
    a tampered tree as clean, or could make the act of checking itself
    execute the attacker's hook. Neither is reachable here: the expected
    side of the comparison comes only from `_git_ls_tree_blobs` (a pure
    object-database read, immune to every filter/hook/attribute a working
    directory can carry) and the actual side comes only from a plain
    filesystem walk hashed in pure Python (`_git_blob_sha1`, no Git
    process touches the on-disk bytes at all) -- there is no git
    invocation left in this function whose output a clone-local
    config/filter/attribute/hook could influence.

    Called immediately after every materialization (closes
    `GPT-R132-001`: a hook that rewrote tracked bytes during checkout
    leaves the checkout's blobs mismatched, caught before any evidence
    executes). `verify_wfo_ledger_coverage` materializes an independent
    checkout per evidence id and never reuses one (`OPUS-R133-001`), so
    this is the only point in that checkout's lifetime this assertion
    needs to run.

    Every Git invocation this function issues -- including its own two
    `rev-parse` calls, not only `_git_ls_tree_blobs`'s -- pins
    `core.hooksPath` to the checkout's own emptied `hooks/` directory, so
    `_git_ls_tree_blobs`'s "every Git invocation this module issues
    against a pinned clone pins it, with no case-by-case exceptions to
    reason about" is true of this whole function too (`OPUS-R134-M02`).
    Both `rev-parse` calls also go through `_hardened_run`
    (`--no-replace-objects`, `OPUS-R136-M02`), matching
    `_git_ls_tree_blobs`, so "detached exactly at `commit`" means the
    literal object `commit` names even if a replacement ref exists in the
    clone.

    The filesystem walk below prunes only the checkout root's own
    administrative `.git/` -- not every directory anywhere in the tree
    that happens to be named `.git` -- and raises on any directory (at
    any depth) left with no files and no subdirectories of its own
    (`OPUS-R136-M03`): a clean checkout of `commit` never produces a
    nested `.git`-named directory or a genuinely empty one, since Git
    does not track directories, only the file paths they hold."""

    closure needs (`_materialize_census`). The prior scripts/-only
    scratch tree (`GPT-R131-001`) left every such evidence id structurally
    unable to execute at all.

    `GPT-R132-001` found the previous `git worktree add --detach`
    implementation still trusted mutable live-repository state: a linked
    worktree shares its common Git directory -- including `.git/hooks`
    -- with `repo_root`, so a `post-checkout` hook installed there after
    technical approval could rewrite tracked evidence bytes during
    materialization, undetected. This now clones into an independent
    repository instead of linking a worktree: `git clone` never copies a
    source repository's own hook scripts (only inert `*.sample`
    templates), so the clone starts with no hooks that could execute at
    all; the `hooks/` directory is then deleted and recreated empty
    regardless, and the checkout pins `core.hooksPath` to that
    now-guaranteed-empty directory, so nothing -- not a template, not
    inherited global/system config -- can reintroduce a live hook path.

    `OPUS-R133-001` found that reusing one such clone across every
    evidence id (resetting and cleaning it between ids) left the reused
    checkout's own `.git/config`/`.git/info/attributes`/`.git/hooks/`
    under the control of whichever evidence id ran previously -- a
    channel `git reset --hard`/`git clean -fdx` never touch, since they
    operate on the work tree, not on `.git/` itself. `verify_wfo_ledger_
    coverage` therefore calls this function once per evidence id and
    tears the result down immediately after
    (`_remove_pinned_worktree`) instead of resetting and reusing it:
    every evidence id gets a brand-new clone that no prior evidence
    process has ever had the chance to touch, so nothing inside a prior
    evidence checkout is reused by a later evidence id.

    `GPT-R135-001` found that the fresh clone this produces was still not
    a fully independent object store: a same-filesystem local `git clone`
    hardlinks `.git/objects` by default rather than copying it, so the
    clone and `repo_root` could hold two pathnames for the same inode --
    an in-place write through the clone's object path could corrupt
    `repo_root`'s own object bytes, and removing the clone afterward would
    not undo that. `--no-hardlinks` forces a real copy of every object
    file into the clone, so its object database has no filesystem-level
    aliasing with `repo_root`'s.

    `GPT-R136-001` found that `--no-hardlinks` alone is not sufficient
    when `repo_root` itself borrows objects through its own
    `objects/info/alternates` (e.g. a source repository created with
    Git's `--reference`): a local clone copies that alternate
    relationship verbatim, so both `repo_root` and the evidence clone
    keep depending on the same external object database. `--dissociate`
    makes Git copy every object reachable through an inherited alternate
    into the clone's own object store and drop the alternate file, so
    the resulting clone never depends on `repo_root`'s object database by
    any path -- hardlink or alternate.

    The initial clone itself is also pinned to a throwaway empty
    `core.hooksPath` (`OPUS-R136-M01`): the clone's own destination
    `.git/hooks/` does not exist yet when the clone command runs, so it
    cannot be pinned to that not-yet-created path the way every later
    call is pinned to it. Without an explicit pin here, inherited
    global/system Git configuration could reintroduce an executable hook
    path during the one Git invocation that had no pin at all.

    The checkout is verified byte-identical to `commit`
    (`_verify_pinned_worktree_clean`) before this function returns, so a
    still-successful hook injection during this specific clone's own
    checkout fails closed here rather than silently producing evidence
    from unreviewed bytes. Caller owns cleanup of a successfully returned
    `scratch_dir` via `_remove_pinned_worktree`; a failure raised from
    within this function (clone, checkout, or the cleanliness check
    itself) removes its own partial `scratch_dir` before propagating,
    since the caller never receives a path to clean up in that case
    (`OPUS-R134-M03`)."""

    (i) **Totality and uniqueness**: every item the reconciliation table
    names (`parse_reconciliation_table`, never the artifact's own
    enumeration) has exactly one ledger entry; a table item with no
    ledger entry (the omission attack), a ledger entry naming no real
    table item, or two ledger entries for the same item (the duplication
    attack, `OPUS-R103-003`) are each a named `FAIL`.

    (ii) **Evidence for every non-`SUPERSEDED`/`none` item** (widened,
    `GPT-R131-002`, to match `WFR-68` property (ii)'s own text -- an
    `IMPLEMENTED` entry must be evidenced "exactly as a `WF8c`-owned entry
    must"): an entry whose ledger `status` is `IMPLEMENTED`, `ABSENT`, or
    `PARTIAL` must name a test id -- its own `evidence` field, or (only
    when that is absent) the companion `<work_item_id>-wf8c-evidence.json`'s
    entry for the same item -- that resolves and re-executes green against
    a real, pinned, detached Git worktree checked out at the commit being
    verified, in a fresh isolated interpreter; an unevidenced or failing
    entry is `FAIL`, never a pass (the relabel attack, and -- previously
    unchecked here at all -- the same silent-omission attack against the
    96 real `WF8c`-owned `ABSENT`/`PARTIAL` items this property now also
    covers). Only `SUPERSEDED` with owner `none` is exempt, satisfied by
    the approved reconciliation table's own recorded supersession alone
    (the identical disposition `WFR-69`'s own pre-flight already treats
    this way).

    (iii)/(iv) **Monotonicity and governance scope**: for every item
    whose ledger `status` differs from the table's own recorded status,
    the *only* permitted difference is an evidenced move to `IMPLEMENTED`
    -- catching the downward-relabel attack (`GPT-R106-001`, e.g. a
    `SUPERSEDED`/`none` rewrite of a still-open item with no corresponding
    plan-revision change) and any other divergence alike. `owner_
    checkpoint` must equal the table's own resolved owner for every item
    regardless of status, since only a fresh approved plan revision may
    change it. The table itself *is* this obligation's baseline --
    property (iv)'s own stated rule for "no prior artifact exists yet",
    true throughout `WF8c`'s own first build of this verifier, since the
    table's per-item `(status, owner)` pairs have not changed since

    specific failing conformance assertions. Marking every registry
    checkpoint `COMPLETE` -- by hand, by `complete_checkpoint(...)`, or
    by any other means -- is therefore not sufficient by itself. This is

    (by id, closure flips distinguishable from direct ones) without this
    function computing anything further -- it stores the map
    `reconcile_checkpoints_after_amendment` already returns, unmodified.
    `plan_revision` itself is never written here -- it stays
    `publish_plan_revision`'s alone.

    A caller that supplies either pre-side reconciliation input
    (`pre_registry`/`pre_plan_text`) against a work item whose last
    `amendment_history` entry is *already* resolved -- a re-run
    reconciliation, the one case `AmendmentAlreadyResolvedError` names in
    its own docstring -- is refused before anything else runs (checked
    ahead of, and independent of, `has_open_amendment`'s own gate below;
    that gate alone can never observe this state, since it is true only
    when the last entry is *not* yet resolved). The guard is keyed on the
    pre-side pair specifically, never on `post_registry`/`post_plan_text`
    alone (`OPUS-R145-001`): the real caller, `approve-review.md` step 4c,
    reads and forwards `post_plan_text`/`post_registry` *unconditionally*,
    from the working tree, on every plan-stage approval regardless of
    amendment state -- only `pre_registry`/`pre_plan_text` are gated there
    on an open amendment. Keying this guard on "any of the four" made it
    fire from that real caller for *any* plan approval following a
    resolved amendment, non-amendment or not, degenerating into "a work
    item that has ever amended once can never have a plan approval applied
    again"; keying it on the pre-side pair alone matches the only shape a
    genuine re-run reconciliation can take (a caller that itself believed
    an amendment was still open). A caller that supplies neither pre-side
    value against an already-resolved amendment stays the ordinary,

) -> dict:
    """`/request-plan-amendment`'s sole writer (D-Plan-Amendment-1/2/3).

    Entry condition: `phase in {"IMPLEMENTING", "SELF_REVIEWING_IMPLEMENTATION"}`
    -- the two phases this release supports, and deliberately the only two
    (`WrongPhaseForAmendmentRequestError` otherwise, naming the actual
    phase; this is also what refuses a second, redundant request against
    an item already at `AMENDING_PLAN`).

    Widened precondition (revision 11/12, I-R11-1/B-R12-1): the current
    `plan_approval`'s own approval commit must actually be discoverable and
    an ancestor of `HEAD` -- checked directly via
    `discover_plan_approval_commit`/`_is_ancestor`, the identical pair
    `implementing_entry_reachable` itself evaluates, never through that
    four-exit composite (which would also, incorrectly, refuse on a
    digest-only staleness this amendment is about to replace anyway).
    Raises `AmendmentApprovalCommitUnreachableError` *before* superseding
    anything -- `plan_approval.status` is never set to `SUPERSEDED` when
    this fires.

    Checkpoint-id-shape precondition (IMPL2-R1, narrowed by IMPL3-R1,
    widened by workflow-2.5.1's `D-Checkpoint-Id-Anchor-Grammar-
    Widening`): before either of the above, loads the work item's own
    current registry (via `_load_authoritative_registry_or_none(repo_root,
    work_item, require_plan_approval_coverage=False)` -- `None` for a
    registry-less work item, which skips this check) and raises
    `AmendmentCheckpointIdShapeError`, naming every offending id, if any
    checkpoint id in it is not of the shape `CP<digits>[A-Z]?`. Such an id
    can never satisfy `validate_post_anchor_coverage`'s anchor grammar no
    matter what the amended plan document says, so refusing here -- before
    `plan_approval` is superseded -- replaces a refusal that would
    otherwise surface only after both plan-review stages have already
    been spent on the amended plan, with no in-band recovery.

    `require_plan_approval_coverage=False` (IMPL3-R1): this call needs only
    the registry's self-declared checkpoint ids, not a proof the registry
    bytes are the ones the current `plan_approval` covers.
    `_load_authoritative_registry_or_none`'s default coverage check
    (`_assert_registry_covered_by_current_plan_approval`) is
    `resolve_own_registry_completion_status`/`resolve_completion_obligations`'s
    own completion-accounting trust boundary; reusing it verbatim here
    reintroduced, through a different door, exactly the digest-only-
    staleness refusal `.claude/commands/request-plan-amendment.md` step 1
    explicitly forbids (`D-Plan-Amendment-1`, `B-R12-1`) -- an operator who
    has started editing `plan_path`/`registry_path` before running this
    command (the single most likely working-tree state for one about to
    request an amendment) was refused with a `StalePlanApprovalRegistryReadError`
    whose message talks about "registry-derived completion", though nothing
    about this command is completion-accounting. Passing `False` restores
    the narrower, id-shape-only read this precondition was designed for;
    the coverage checks other two call sites still need are unaffected.

    In one `state_transaction`-compatible mutation: sets
    `plan_approval.status = "SUPERSEDED"`; appends one entry to the
    work item's own append-only `amendment_history` list (bounded,
    content-addressed reference model, EXT-R6-I1: `superseded_plan_approval`
    is a deep copy of the record just superseded -- its own
    `review_content_manifest` already pins the exact blob SHAs of
    `plan_path`/`registry_path` at the moment it was made;
    `pre_amendment_approval_commit` is the single commit SHA that
    reproduces those bytes later via `load_pre_amendment_snapshot`, never
    a stored copy of the documents themselves); sets `amendment_base_commit`
    to the current `HEAD`; and writes `phase = "AMENDING_PLAN"` as a direct
    string literal (never through a local name), so the AST-derived phase
    census resolves it without a third hardcoded compensation entry. For a
    `TWO_STAGE_PLAN_REVIEW_VERSIONS` item it also writes the `CONSUMED`
    `plan_review_binding` record from `plan_approval.approved_review_content_id`
    and the current mirror (`D-Plan-Review-Bundle-Binding`, workflow-2.6.0).

    This function performs one read of Git identity (`HEAD`'s own SHA, and
    the reachability check above) -- both are needed to compute the exact
    `amendment_history` entry this function itself writes, the same
    narrow exception to pure-`state`-only mutators D-Plan-Amendment-3
    grants this one writer and no other.

    workflow-2.6.0, `D-Repo-Global-Lifecycle` ("No bypass"): refuses
    first, with `LifecycleLockNotHeldError`, unless this process holds the
    repository-global lifecycle lock (9) for `work_item_id`. The only
    sanctioned caller is `request_plan_amendment_transaction`, which takes
    (9), runs the amendment side of the witness predicate list, and
    publishes the `OPEN` witness inside this mutator's `state_transaction`
    before the state -- so the `resolve_claim` quiescence read below is
    serialized with every claim publication in every linked worktree."""

    implicitly against any other item or phase (`LegacyAdoptionWrongPhaseError`
    guards misuse defensively, mirroring `import_legacy_work_item`'s own
    `LegacyImportAlreadyExistsError` guard).

    Re-validates, never trusts from import time:
    1. the branch-reconciliation precondition (`verify_legacy_branch_
       reconciliation`) -- a dormant item can sit for a long time between
       import and adoption;
    2. `technical_approval` freshness, via `any_protected_path_changed_
       since(reviewed_content_commit, "HEAD", ...)` scoped to
       `work_item_id`'s own `artifacts_path` -- deliberately not
       `approval_is_current`'s exact-hash-reproduction, which would
       permanently misfire here (see that function's own docstring): a
       dormant legacy entry's declarations file legitimately needs
       widening, after import, to classify paths a concurrent work item
       introduces while it waits, and that widening alone must never read
       as staleness. A real `protected` path change since
       `reviewed_content_commit` raises `LegacyAdoptionStaleApprovalError`
       and stops outright: adoption never re-imports, a stale legacy
       approval is handled exactly like a stale ordinary one, through the
       normal `technical_approval` lifecycle (D-Approval-Commits).

    On success: `active_work_item_id` is set to `work_item_id`,
    `governing_workflow_version` transitions `"1"` -> `"2.1"` (an
    ordinary, auditable version transition -- resolves `OPUS-R10-011`), and
    `phase` transitions to `AWAITING_FUNCTIONAL_REVIEW` -- `technical_approval`
    itself is preserved exactly as imported (`basis: LEGACY_V1`, untouched);
    adoption changes routing, never the approval record.

    **The `"2.1"` destination is a deliberate literal, corrected
    workflow-2.5.0 (resolves `LOCAL_MODEL_PLAN_REVIEW` round 6, optional
    finding 1): never `config["default_workflow_version"]`.** A legacy
    item adopted here is, by construction, already past both
    implementation-review stages `D-Implementation-Review-Stages` adds at
    `"2.2"` -- it was built and reviewed entirely under Workflow v1, then
    imported with a `LEGACY_V1`-basis `technical_approval` already in hand
    (`import_legacy_work_item`), so there is no implementation-review round
    left for it to run through, whatever the repository's own current
    default version is. Promoting it to the current default instead --
    even after this repository has separately activated `"2.2"`
    (`workflow_state_activate`/`WF-Activate`) -- would retroactively assign
    it a two-stage implementation-review obligation it can never satisfy,
    since it has no future implementation round left in which to satisfy
    it. `"2.1"` is therefore always correct: it is the version at which
    `D-Legacy` phase 2 first became possible, still ahead of
    `D-Implementation-Review-Stages`' own additional scope, and it names
    that fact directly rather than deferring to whatever configuration
    happens to be active at adoption time.

    **`artifacts_path` has no default** (salvage audit `I6`): it used to
    default to `fingerprint.DEFAULT_ARTIFACTS_PATH`, `workflow-v2-1-core`'s
    own declarations file, even though `/prepare-functional-review` step
    0a's own text says to pass "this item's own artifact-declarations
    file, not `workflow-v2-1-core`'s". A caller that omitted it evaluated
    check 2 against a *process* item's classification, in which `app/` is
    `excluded` -- so a legacy *product* item whose product code genuinely
    changed since `reviewed_content_commit` was promoted with a `CURRENT`
    legacy approval instead of being refused. Reproduced by execution; the
    argument is now required, so omitting it is a loud `TypeError` rather

    receives already-parsed data.

    **This function has no production caller anywhere in this repository**
    (external cross-model review, `workflow-v2-3-followups` continued
    scope, round 4): it is a write-time/harness backstop only -- test
    suites and the test harness call it, no `.claude/commands/*.md` file,

    (the documented single required entry point for every production
    writer) does not call it either. Do not infer that a check added here
    protects any real read path; a check that must protect production
    consumption belongs at that consumer's own chokepoint too
    (`OPUS-R25-007`'s own precedent -- see e.g.
    `_assert_registry_covered_by_current_plan_approval`/
    `_resolve_one_obligation`'s own `review_content_manifest` shape
    guards, which this function's own equivalent check does not reach).

    `registry`, if given, is a single caller-supplied registry dict used
    for the checkpoint-dependency check below and, if its own
    `work_item_id` names a known item, that one item's plan-revision
    mirror -- unchanged from before `GPT-R31-003`, kept for callers that
    only ever validate one work item's checkpoints against its own
    registry.

    `repo_root`, if given, is the **whole-state** plan-revision-mirror
    check `GPT-R31-003` requires: every work item with a non-null
    `registry_path` has that path resolved and read from disk (relative to
    `repo_root`), independent of whichever single `registry` a caller
    happened to also pass -- so a caller validating `workflow-v2-1-core`'s
    own registry can no longer leave a different work item's stale mirror
    undetected. `registry_path` is resolved through
    `fingerprint._validate_plan_stage_metadata_path`, the same *tracked*
    metadata-path validator plan-stage resolution uses (`GPT-R32-001`,
    tightened by `GPT-R33-002`) -- an absolute path, a `../` traversal, a
    symlink at any path component, a path that does not exist as a
    regular file, or a path that exists but is not a Git-tracked file all
    fail closed as `MissingRegistryForPlanRevisionMirrorCheckError` rather
    than silently reading whatever `repo_root / registry_path` happens to
    join to (an untracked file would otherwise become the authoritative
    comparison source for a mirror check meant to police tracked,
    committed metadata). Malformed JSON or a JSON value that is not an
    object fails the same way, by name, instead of a raw
    `JSONDecodeError`/`AttributeError` (`GPT-R33-004`). The loaded
    registry must also declare the exact same `work_item_id` as the
    state-map key that named it (`RegistryWorkItemIdMismatchError`,
    `GPT-R32-003`) and a valid integer `plan_revision >= 1`
    (`InvalidRegistryPlanRevisionError`, `GPT-R32-002`) -- neither
    cross-wired registry ownership nor a malformed revision are silently
    treated as "nothing to check". A `null` `registry_path` remains
